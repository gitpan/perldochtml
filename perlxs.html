perlxs - XS language reference manual
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
XS is an interface description file format used to create an extension
interface between Perl and C code (or a C library) which one wishes
to use with Perl.  The XS interface is combined with the library to
create a new library which can then be either dynamically loaded
or statically linked into perl.  The XS interface description is
written in the XS language and is the core component of the Perl
extension interface.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
An <b>XSUB</b> forms the basic unit of the XS interface.  After compilation
by the <b>xsubpp</b> compiler, each XSUB amounts to a C function definition
which will provide the glue between Perl calling conventions and C
calling conventions.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The glue code pulls the arguments from the Perl stack, converts these
Perl values to the formats expected by a C function, call this C function,
transfers the return values of the C function back to Perl.
Return values here may be a conventional C return value or any C
function arguments that may serve as output parameters.  These return
values may be passed back to Perl either by putting them on the
Perl stack, or by modifying the arguments supplied from the Perl side.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The above is a somewhat simplified view of what really happens.  Since
Perl allows more flexible calling conventions than C, XSUBs may do much
more in practice, such as checking input parameters for validity,
throwing exceptions (or returning undef/empty list) if the return value
from the C function indicates failure, calling different C functions
based on numbers and types of the arguments, providing an object-oriented
interface, etc.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Of course, one could write such glue code directly in C.  However, this
would be a tedious task, especially if one needs to write glue for
multiple C functions, and/or one is not familiar enough with the Perl
stack discipline and other such arcana.  XS comes to the rescue here:
instead of writing this glue C code in long-hand, one can write
a more concise short-hand <i>description</i> of what should be done by
the glue, and let the XS compiler <b>xsubpp</b> handle the rest.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The XS language allows one to describe the mapping between how the C
routine is used, and how the corresponding Perl routine is used.  It
also allows creation of Perl routines which are directly translated to
C code and which are not related to a pre-existing C function.  In cases
when the C interface coincides with the Perl interface, the XSUB
declaration is almost identical to a declaration of a C function (in K&amp;R
style).  In such circumstances, there is another tool called <code>h2xs</code>
that is able to translate an entire C header file into a corresponding
XS file that will provide glue to the functions/macros described in
the header file.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The XS compiler is called <b>xsubpp</b>.  This compiler creates
the constructs necessary to let an XSUB manipulate Perl values, and
creates the glue necessary to let Perl call the XSUB.  The compiler
uses <b>typemaps</b> to determine how to map C function parameters
and output values to Perl values and back.  The default typemap
(which comes with Perl) handles many common C types.  A supplementary
typemap may also be needed to handle any special structures and types
for the library being linked.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
A file in XS format starts with a C language section which goes until the
first <code>MODULE =</code> directive.  Other XS directives and XSUB definitions
may follow this line.  The &quot;language&quot; used in this part of the file
is usually referred to as the XS language.  <b>xsubpp</b> recognizes and
skips POD (see the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlpod.html">perlpod</a> manpage) in both the C and XS language sections, which
allows the XS file to contain embedded documentation.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlxstut.html">perlxstut</a> manpage for a tutorial on the whole extension creation process.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Note: For some extensions, Dave Beazley's SWIG system may provide a
significantly more convenient mechanism for creating the extension
glue code.  See http://www.swig.org/ for more information.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="On_The_Road">On The Road</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Many of the examples which follow will concentrate on creating an interface
between Perl and the ONC+ RPC bind library functions.  The rpcb_gettime()
function is used to demonstrate many features of the XS language.  This
function has two parameters; the first is an input parameter and the second
is an output parameter.  The function also returns a status value.

	bool_t rpcb_gettime(const char *host, time_t *timep);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
From C this function will be called with the following
statements.

     #include &lt;rpc/rpc.h&gt;
     bool_t status;
     time_t timep;
     status = rpcb_gettime( &quot;localhost&quot;, &amp;timep );
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If an XSUB is created to offer a direct translation between this function
and Perl, then this XSUB will be used from Perl with the following code.
The $status and $timep variables will contain the output of the function.

     use RPC;
     $status = rpcb_gettime( &quot;localhost&quot;, $timep );
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The following XS file shows an XS subroutine, or XSUB, which
demonstrates one possible interface to the rpcb_gettime()
function.  This XSUB represents a direct translation between
C and Perl and so preserves the interface even from Perl.
This XSUB will be invoked from Perl with the usage shown
above.  Note that the first three #include statements, for
<code>EXTERN.h</code>, <code>perl.h</code>, and <code>XSUB.h</code>, will always be present at the
beginning of an XS file.  This approach and others will be
expanded later in this document.

     #include &quot;EXTERN.h&quot;
     #include &quot;perl.h&quot;
     #include &quot;XSUB.h&quot;
     #include &lt;rpc/rpc.h&gt;

     MODULE = RPC  PACKAGE = RPC

     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(host,timep)
          char *host
          time_t &amp;timep
        OUTPUT:
          timep
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Any extension to Perl, including those containing XSUBs,
should have a Perl module to serve as the bootstrap which
pulls the extension into Perl.  This module will export the
extension's functions and variables to the Perl program and
will cause the extension's XSUBs to be linked into Perl.
The following module will be used for most of the examples
in this document and should be used from Perl with the <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#use_Module_LIST">use</a></code>
command as shown earlier.  Perl modules are explained in
more detail later in this document.

     package RPC;

     require Exporter;
     require DynaLoader;
     @ISA = qw(Exporter DynaLoader);
     @EXPORT = qw( rpcb_gettime );

     bootstrap RPC;
     1;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Throughout this document a variety of interfaces to the rpcb_gettime()
XSUB will be explored.  The XSUBs will take their parameters in different
orders or will take different numbers of parameters.  In each case the
XSUB is an abstraction between Perl and the real C rpcb_gettime()
function, and the XSUB must always ensure that the real rpcb_gettime()
function is called with the correct parameters.  This abstraction will
allow the programmer to create a more Perl-like interface to the C
function.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_Anatomy_of_an_XS">The Anatomy of an XSUB</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The simplest XSUBs consist of 3 parts: a description of the return
value, the name of the XSUB routine and the names of its arguments,
and a description of types or formats of the arguments.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The following XSUB allows a Perl program to access a C library function
called sin().  The XSUB will imitate the C function which takes a single
argument and returns a single value.

     double
     sin(x)
       double x
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Optionally, one can merge the description of types and the list of
argument names, rewriting this as

     double
     sin(double x)
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This makes this XSUB look similar to an ANSI C declaration.  An optional
semicolon is allowed after the argument list, as in

     double
     sin(double x);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Parameters with C pointer types can have different semantic: C functions
with similar declarations

     bool string_looks_as_a_number(char *s);
     bool make_char_uppercase(char *c);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
are used in absolutely incompatible manner.  Parameters to these functions
could be described <b>xsubpp</b> like this:

     char *  s
     char    &amp;c
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Both these XS declarations correspond to the <code>char*</code> C type, but they have
different semantics, see the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="#The_Unary_Operator">The &amp; Unary Operator</a> elsewhere in this document.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
It is convenient to think that the indirection operator
<code>*</code> should be considered as a part of the type and the address operator <code>&amp;</code>
should be considered part of the variable.  See the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="#The_Typemap">The Typemap</a> elsewhere in this document
for more info about handling qualifiers and unary operators in C types.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The function name and the return type must be placed on
separate lines and should be flush left-adjusted.

  INCORRECT                        CORRECT

  double sin(x)                    double
    double x                       sin(x)
				     double x
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The rest of the function description may be indented or left-adjusted. The
following example shows a function with its body left-adjusted.  Most
examples in this document will indent the body for better readability.

  CORRECT

  double
  sin(x)
  double x
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
More complicated XSUBs may contain many other sections.  Each section of
an XSUB starts with the corresponding keyword, such as INIT: or CLEANUP:.
However, the first two lines of an XSUB always contain the same data:
descriptions of the return type and the names of the function and its
parameters.  Whatever immediately follows these is considered to be
an INPUT: section unless explicitly marked with another keyword.
(See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="#The_INPUT_Keyword">The INPUT: Keyword</a> entry elsewhere in this document.)
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
An XSUB section continues until another section-start keyword is found.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_Argument_Stack">The Argument Stack</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The Perl argument stack is used to store the values which are
sent as parameters to the XSUB and to store the XSUB's
return value(s).  In reality all Perl functions (including non-XSUB
ones) keep their values on this stack all the same time, each limited
to its own range of positions on the stack.  In this document the
first position on that stack which belongs to the active
function will be referred to as position 0 for that function.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
XSUBs refer to their stack arguments with the macro <b>ST(x)</b>, where <i>x</i>
refers to a position in this XSUB's part of the stack.  Position 0 for that
function would be known to the XSUB as ST(0).  The XSUB's incoming
parameters and outgoing return values always begin at ST(0).  For many
simple cases the <b>xsubpp</b> compiler will generate the code necessary to
handle the argument stack by embedding code fragments found in the
typemaps.  In more complex cases the programmer must supply the code.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_RETVAL_Variable">The RETVAL Variable</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The RETVAL variable is a special C variable that is declared automatically
for you.  The C type of RETVAL matches the return type of the C library
function.  The <b>xsubpp</b> compiler will declare this variable in each XSUB
with non-<code>void</code> return type.  By default the generated C function
will use RETVAL to hold the return value of the C library function being
called.  In simple cases the value of RETVAL will be placed in ST(0) of
the argument stack where it can be received by Perl as the return value
of the XSUB.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If the XSUB has a return type of <code>void</code> then the compiler will
not declare a RETVAL variable for that function.  When using
a PPCODE: section no manipulation of the RETVAL variable is required, the
section may use direct stack manipulation to place output values on the stack.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If PPCODE: directive is not used, <code>void</code> return value should be used
only for subroutines which do not return a value, <i>even if</i> CODE:
directive is used which sets ST(0) explicitly.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Older versions of this document recommended to use <code>void</code> return
value in such cases. It was discovered that this could lead to
segfaults in cases when XSUB was <i>truly</i> <code>void</code>. This practice is
now deprecated, and may be not supported at some future version. Use
the return value <code>SV *</code> in such cases. (Currently <code>xsubpp</code> contains
some heuristic code which tries to disambiguate between &quot;truly-void&quot;
and &quot;old-practice-declared-as-void&quot; functions. Hence your code is at
mercy of this heuristics unless you use <code>SV *</code> as return value.)
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_MODULE_Keyword">The MODULE Keyword</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The MODULE keyword is used to start the XS code and to specify the package
of the functions which are being defined.  All text preceding the first
MODULE keyword is considered C code and is passed through to the output with
POD stripped, but otherwise untouched.  Every XS module will have a
bootstrap function which is used to hook the XSUBs into Perl.  The package
name of this bootstrap function will match the value of the last MODULE
statement in the XS source files.  The value of MODULE should always remain
constant within the same XS file, though this is not required.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The following example will start the XS code and will place
all functions in a package named RPC.

     MODULE = RPC
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_PACKAGE_Keyword">The PACKAGE Keyword</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
When functions within an XS source file must be separated into packages
the PACKAGE keyword should be used.  This keyword is used with the MODULE
keyword and must follow immediately after it when used.

     MODULE = RPC  PACKAGE = RPC

     [ XS code in package RPC ]

     MODULE = RPC  PACKAGE = RPCB

     [ XS code in package RPCB ]

     MODULE = RPC  PACKAGE = RPC

     [ XS code in package RPC ]
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Although this keyword is optional and in some cases provides redundant
information it should always be used.  This keyword will ensure that the
XSUBs appear in the desired package.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_PREFIX_Keyword">The PREFIX Keyword</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The PREFIX keyword designates prefixes which should be
removed from the Perl function names.  If the C function is
<code>rpcb_gettime()</code> and the PREFIX value is <code>rpcb_</code> then Perl will
see this function as <code>gettime()</code>.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This keyword should follow the PACKAGE keyword when used.
If PACKAGE is not used then PREFIX should follow the MODULE
keyword.

     MODULE = RPC  PREFIX = rpc_

     MODULE = RPC  PACKAGE = RPCB  PREFIX = rpcb_
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_OUTPUT_Keyword">The OUTPUT: Keyword</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The OUTPUT: keyword indicates that certain function parameters should be
updated (new values made visible to Perl) when the XSUB terminates or that
certain values should be returned to the calling Perl function.  For
simple functions which have no CODE: or PPCODE: section,
such as the sin() function above, the RETVAL variable is
automatically designated as an output value.  For more complex functions
the <b>xsubpp</b> compiler will need help to determine which variables are output
variables.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This keyword will normally be used to complement the CODE:  keyword.
The RETVAL variable is not recognized as an output variable when the
CODE: keyword is present.  The OUTPUT:  keyword is used in this
situation to tell the compiler that RETVAL really is an output
variable.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The OUTPUT: keyword can also be used to indicate that function parameters
are output variables.  This may be necessary when a parameter has been
modified within the function and the programmer would like the update to
be seen by Perl.

     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(host,timep)
          char *host
          time_t &amp;timep
        OUTPUT:
          timep
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The OUTPUT: keyword will also allow an output parameter to
be mapped to a matching piece of code rather than to a
typemap.

     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(host,timep)
          char *host
          time_t &amp;timep
        OUTPUT:
          timep sv_setnv(ST(1), (double)timep);
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
<b>xsubpp</b> emits an automatic <code>SvSETMAGIC()</code> for all parameters in the
OUTPUT section of the XSUB, except RETVAL.  This is the usually desired
behavior, as it takes care of properly invoking 'set' magic on output
parameters (needed for hash or array element parameters that must be
created if they didn't exist).  If for some reason, this behavior is
not desired, the OUTPUT section may contain a <code>SETMAGIC: DISABLE</code> line
to disable it for the remainder of the parameters in the OUTPUT section.
Likewise,  <code>SETMAGIC: ENABLE</code> can be used to reenable it for the
remainder of the OUTPUT section.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlguts.html">perlguts</a> manpage for more details
about 'set' magic.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_NO_OUTPUT_Keywor">The NO_OUTPUT Keyword</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The NO_OUTPUT can be placed as the first token of the XSUB.  This keyword
indicates that while the C subroutine we provide an interface to has
a non-<code>void</code> return type, the return value of this C subroutine should not
be returned from the generated Perl subroutine.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
With this keyword present the <a class="POD_LINK" href="#The_RETVAL_Variable">The RETVAL Variable</a> entry elsewhere in this document is created, and in the
generated call to the subroutine this variable is assigned to, but the value
of this variable is not going to be used in the auto-generated code.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This keyword makes sense only if <code>RETVAL</code> is going to be accessed by the
user-supplied code.  It is especially useful to make a function interface
more Perl-like, especially when the C return value is just an error condition
indicator.  For example,

  NO_OUTPUT int
  delete_file(char *name)
    POST_CALL:
      if (RETVAL != 0)
	  croak(&quot;Error %d while deleting file '%s'&quot;, RETVAL, name);
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Here the generated XS function returns nothing on success, and will die()
with a meaningful error message on error.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_CODE_Keyword">The CODE: Keyword</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This keyword is used in more complicated XSUBs which require
special handling for the C function.  The RETVAL variable is
still declared, but it will not be returned unless it is specified
in the OUTPUT: section.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The following XSUB is for a C function which requires special handling of
its parameters.  The Perl usage is given first.

     $status = rpcb_gettime( &quot;localhost&quot;, $timep );
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The XSUB follows.

     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(host,timep)
          char *host
          time_t timep
        CODE:
               RETVAL = rpcb_gettime( host, &amp;timep );
        OUTPUT:
          timep
          RETVAL
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_INIT_Keyword">The INIT: Keyword</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The INIT: keyword allows initialization to be inserted into the XSUB before
the compiler generates the call to the C function.  Unlike the CODE: keyword
above, this keyword does not affect the way the compiler handles RETVAL.

    bool_t
    rpcb_gettime(host,timep)
          char *host
          time_t &amp;timep
	INIT:
	  printf(&quot;# Host is %s\n&quot;, host );
        OUTPUT:
          timep
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Another use for the INIT: section is to check for preconditions before
making a call to the C function:

    long long
    lldiv(a,b)
	long long a
	long long b
      INIT:
	if (a == 0 &amp;&amp; b == 0)
	    XSRETURN_UNDEF;
	if (b == 0)
	    croak(&quot;lldiv: cannot divide by 0&quot;);
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_NO_INIT_Keyword">The NO_INIT Keyword</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The NO_INIT keyword is used to indicate that a function
parameter is being used only as an output value.  The <b>xsubpp</b>
compiler will normally generate code to read the values of
all function parameters from the argument stack and assign
them to C variables upon entry to the function.  NO_INIT
will tell the compiler that some parameters will be used for
output rather than for input and that they will be handled
before the function terminates.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The following example shows a variation of the rpcb_gettime() function.
This function uses the timep variable only as an output variable and does
not care about its initial contents.

     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(host,timep)
          char *host
          time_t &amp;timep = NO_INIT

<p class="POD_TEXT">
C function parameters are normally initialized with their values from
the argument stack (which in turn contains the parameters that were
passed to the XSUB from Perl).  The typemaps contain the
code segments which are used to translate the Perl values to
the C parameters.  The programmer, however, is allowed to
override the typemaps and supply alternate (or additional)
initialization code.  Initialization code starts with the first
<code>=</code>, <code>;</code> or <code>+</code> on a line in the INPUT: section.  The only
exception happens if this <code>;</code> terminates the line, then this <code>;</code>
is quietly ignored.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The following code demonstrates how to supply initialization code for
function parameters.  The initialization code is eval'd within double
quotes by the compiler before it is added to the output so anything
which should be interpreted literally [mainly <code>$</code>, <code>@</code>, or <code>\\</code>]
must be protected with backslashes.  The variables $var, $arg,
and $type can be used as in typemaps.

     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(host,timep)
          char *host = (char *)SvPV($arg,PL_na);
          time_t &amp;timep = 0;
        OUTPUT:
          timep
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This should not be used to supply default values for parameters.  One
would normally use this when a function parameter must be processed by
another library function before it can be used.  Default parameters are
covered in the next section.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If the initialization begins with <code>=</code>, then it is output in
the declaration for the input variable, replacing the initialization
supplied by the typemap.  If the initialization
begins with <code>;</code> or <code>+</code>, then it is performed after
all of the input variables have been declared.  In the <code>;</code>
case the initialization normally supplied by the typemap is not performed.
For the <code>+</code> case, the declaration for the variable will include the
initialization from the typemap.  A global
variable, <code>%v</code>, is available for the truly rare case where
information from one initialization is needed in another
initialization.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Here's a truly obscure example:

     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(host,timep)
          time_t &amp;timep ; /* \$v{timep}=@{[$v{timep}=$arg]} */
          char *host + SvOK($v{timep}) ? SvPV($arg,PL_na) : NULL;
        OUTPUT:
          timep
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The construct <code>\$v{timep}=@{[$v{timep}=$arg]}</code> used in the above
example has a two-fold purpose: first, when this line is processed by
<b>xsubpp</b>, the Perl snippet <code>$v{timep}=$arg</code> is evaluated.  Second,
the text of the evaluated snippet is output into the generated C file
(inside a C comment)!  During the processing of <code>char *host</code> line,
$arg will evaluate to <code>ST(0)</code>, and <code>$v{timep}</code> will evaluate to
<code>ST(1)</code>.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Default_Parameter_Va">Default Parameter Values</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Default values for XSUB arguments can be specified by placing an
assignment statement in the parameter list.  The default value may
be a number, a string or the special string <code>NO_INIT</code>.  Defaults should
always be used on the right-most parameters only.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
To allow the XSUB for rpcb_gettime() to have a default host
value the parameters to the XSUB could be rearranged.  The
XSUB will then call the real rpcb_gettime() function with
the parameters in the correct order.  This XSUB can be called
from Perl with either of the following statements:

     $status = rpcb_gettime( $timep, $host );

     $status = rpcb_gettime( $timep );
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The XSUB will look like the code  which  follows.   A  CODE:
block  is used to call the real rpcb_gettime() function with
the parameters in the correct order for that function.

     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(timep,host=&quot;localhost&quot;)
          char *host
          time_t timep = NO_INIT

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_PREINIT_Keyword">The PREINIT: Keyword</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The PREINIT: keyword allows extra variables to be declared immediately
before or after the declarations of the parameters from the INPUT: section
are emitted.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If a variable is declared inside a CODE: section it will follow any typemap
code that is emitted for the input parameters.  This may result in the
declaration ending up after C code, which is C syntax error.  Similar
errors may happen with an explicit <code>;</code>-type or <code>+</code>-type initialization of
parameters is used (see the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="#Initializing_Functio">Initializing Function Parameters</a> elsewhere in this document).  Declaring
these variables in an INIT: section will not help.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In such cases, to force an additional variable to be declared together
with declarations of other variables, place the declaration into a
PREINIT: section.  The PREINIT: keyword may be used one or more times
within an XSUB.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The following examples are equivalent, but if the code is using complex
typemaps then the first example is safer.

     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(timep)
          time_t timep = NO_INIT
	PREINIT:
          char *host = &quot;localhost&quot;;
        CODE:
	  RETVAL = rpcb_gettime( host, &amp;timep );
        OUTPUT:
          timep
          RETVAL
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
For this particular case an INIT: keyword would generate the
same C code as the PREINIT: keyword.  Another correct, but error-prone example:

     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(timep)
          time_t timep = NO_INIT
	CODE:
          char *host = &quot;localhost&quot;;
	  RETVAL = rpcb_gettime( host, &amp;timep );
        OUTPUT:
          timep
          RETVAL
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Another way to declare <code>host</code> is to use a C block in the CODE: section:

     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(timep)
          time_t timep = NO_INIT
	CODE:
	  {
            char *host = &quot;localhost&quot;;
	    RETVAL = rpcb_gettime( host, &amp;timep );
	  }
        OUTPUT:
          timep
          RETVAL
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The ability to put additional declarations before the typemap entries are
processed is very handy in the cases when typemap conversions manipulate
some global state:

    MyObject
    mutate(o)
	PREINIT:
	    MyState st = global_state;
	INPUT:
	    MyObject o;
	CLEANUP:
	    reset_to(global_state, st);
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Here we suppose that conversion to <code>MyObject</code> in the INPUT: section and from
MyObject when processing RETVAL will modify a global variable <code>global_state</code>.
After these conversions are performed, we restore the old value of
<code>global_state</code> (to avoid memory leaks, for example).
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
There is another way to trade clarity for compactness: INPUT sections allow
declaration of C variables which do not appear in the parameter list of
a subroutine.  Thus the above code for mutate() can be rewritten as

    MyObject
    mutate(o)
	  MyState st = global_state;
	  MyObject o;
	CLEANUP:
	  reset_to(global_state, st);
</pre>

and the code for rpcb_gettime() can be rewritten as

     bool_t
     rpcb_gettime(timep)
	  time_t timep = NO_INIT
	  char *host = &quot;localhost&quot;;
	C_ARGS:

The XSUB's parameters are usually evaluated immediately after entering the

evaluated a little later.  The INPUT: keyword can be used multiple times
within an XSUB and can be used to list one or more input variables.  This
keyword is used with the PREINIT: keyword.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The following example shows how the input parameter <code>timep</code> can be
evaluated late, after a PREINIT.

<p class="POD_TEXT">
(We used our knowledge that input conversion for <code>char *</code> is a &quot;simple&quot; one,
thus <code>host</code> is initialized on the declaration line, and our assignment
<code>h = host</code> is not performed too early.  Otherwise one would need to have the
assignment <code>h = host</code> in a CODE: or INIT: section.)

XSUBs can have variable-length parameter lists by specifying an ellipsis

The actual difference between PPCODE: and CODE: sections is in the
initialization of <code>SP</code> macro (which stands for the <i>current</i> Perl

from an XSUB.  In CODE: sections SP preserves the value which was on
entry to the XSUB: SP is on the function pointer (which follows the
last parameter).  In PPCODE: sections SP is moved backward to the

to place output values in the place Perl expects them to be when
the XSUB returns back to Perl.

C and XS language sections. POD must be terminated with a <code>=cut</code> command;
<code>xsubpp</code> will exit with an error if it does not. It is very unlikely that
human generated C code will be mistaken for POD, as most indenting styles
result in whitespace in front of any line starting with <code>=</code>. Machine
generated XS files may fall into this trap unless care is taken to
ensure that a space breaks the sequence &quot;\n=&quot;.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Comments can be added to XSUBs by placing a <code>#</code> as the first

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Interface_Strategy">Interface Strategy</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
When designing an interface between Perl and a C library a straight
translation from C to XS (such as created by <code>h2xs -x</code>) is often sufficient.
However, sometimes the interface will look
very C-like and occasionally nonintuitive, especially when the C function
modifies one of its parameters, or returns failure inband (as in &quot;negative
return values mean failure&quot;).  In cases where the programmer wishes to
create a more Perl-like interface the following strategy may help to
identify the more critical parts of the interface.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Identify the C functions with input/output or output parameters.  The XSUBs for
these functions may be able to return lists to Perl.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Identify the C functions which use some inband info as an indication
of failure.  They may be
candidates to return undef or an empty list in case of failure.  If the
failure may be detected without a call to the C function, you may want to use
an INIT: section to report the failure.  For failures detectable after the C
function returns one may want to use a POST_CALL: section to process the
failure.  In more complicated cases use CODE: or PPCODE: sections.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If many functions use the same failure indication based on the return value,
you may want to create a special typedef to handle this situation.  Put

  typedef int negative_is_failure;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
near the beginning of XS file, and create an OUTPUT typemap entry
for <code>negative_is_failure</code> which converts negative values to <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#undef">undef</a></code>, or
maybe croak()s.  After this the return value of type <code>negative_is_failure</code>
will create more Perl-like interface.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Identify which values are used by only the C and XSUB functions
themselves, say, when a parameter to a function should be a contents of a
global variable.  If Perl does not need to access the contents of the value
then it may not be necessary to provide a translation for that value
from C to Perl.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Identify the pointers in the C function parameter lists and return
values.  Some pointers may be used to implement input/output or
output parameters, they can be handled in XS with the <code>&amp;</code> unary operator,
and, possibly, using the NO_INIT keyword.
Some others will require handling of types like <code>int *</code>, and one needs
to decide what a useful Perl translation will do in such a case.  When
the semantic is clear, it is advisable to put the translation into a typemap
file.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Identify the structures used by the C functions.  In many
cases it may be helpful to use the T_PTROBJ typemap for
these structures so they can be manipulated by Perl as
blessed objects.  (This is handled automatically by <code>h2xs -x</code>.)
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If the same C type is used in several different contexts which require
different translations, <code>typedef</code> several new types mapped to this C type,
and create separate <code>typemap</code> entries for these new types.  Use these
types in declarations of return type and parameters to XSUBs.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Perl_Objects_And_C_S">Perl Objects And C Structures</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
When dealing with C structures one should select either
<b>T_PTROBJ</b> or <b>T_PTRREF</b> for the XS type.  Both types are
designed to handle pointers to complex objects.  The
T_PTRREF type will allow the Perl object to be unblessed
while the T_PTROBJ type requires that the object be blessed.
By using T_PTROBJ one can achieve a form of type-checking
because the XSUB will attempt to verify that the Perl object
is of the expected type.

consider this reference to be a pointer to a blessed object and will
attempt to call a destructor for the object.  A destructor will be
provided in the XS source to free the memory used by getnetconfigent().
Destructors in XS can be created by specifying an XSUB function whose name

This example will be used with the following Perl statements.

     $netconf = getnetconfigent(&quot;udp&quot;);

<p class="POD_TEXT">
When Perl destroys the object referenced by $netconf it will send the
object to the supplied XSUB DESTROY function.  Perl cannot determine, and
does not care, that this object is a C struct and not a Perl object.  In
this sense, there is no difference between the object created by the
getnetconfigent() XSUB and an object created by a normal Perl subroutine.

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_Typemap">The Typemap</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The typemap is a collection of code fragments which are used by the <b>xsubpp</b>
compiler to map C function parameters and values to Perl values.  The
typemap file may consist of three sections labelled <code>TYPEMAP</code>, <code>INPUT</code>, and
<code>OUTPUT</code>.  An unlabelled initial section is assumed to be a <code>TYPEMAP</code>
section.  The INPUT section tells
the compiler how to translate Perl values
into variables of certain C types.  The OUTPUT section tells the compiler
how to translate the values from certain C types into values Perl can
understand.  The TYPEMAP section tells the compiler which of the INPUT and
OUTPUT code fragments should be used to map a given C type to a Perl value.
The section labels <code>TYPEMAP</code>, <code>INPUT</code>, or <code>OUTPUT</code> must begin
in the first column on a line by themselves, and must be in uppercase.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The default typemap in the <code>lib/ExtUtils</code> directory of the Perl source
contains many useful types which can be used by Perl extensions.  Some
extensions define additional typemaps which they keep in their own directory.
These additional typemaps may reference INPUT and OUTPUT maps in the main
typemap.  The <b>xsubpp</b> compiler will allow the extension's own typemap to
override any mappings which are in the default typemap.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Most extensions which require a custom typemap will need only the TYPEMAP
section of the typemap file.  The custom typemap used in the
getnetconfigent() example shown earlier demonstrates what may be the typical
use of extension typemaps.  That typemap is used to equate a C structure
with the T_PTROBJ typemap.  The typemap used by getnetconfigent() is shown
here.  Note that the C type is separated from the XS type with a tab and
that the C unary operator <code>*</code> is considered to be a part of the C type name.

	Netconfig *&lt;tab&gt;T_PTROBJ

<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Here's a more complicated example: suppose that you wanted <code>struct
netconfig</code> to be blessed into the class <code>Net::Config</code>.  One way to do
this is to use underscores (_) to separate package names, as follows:

        typedef struct netconfig * Net_Config;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
And then provide a typemap entry <code>T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL</code> that maps underscores to
double-colons (::), and declare <code>Net_Config</code> to be of that type:
</p>
<pre>
        TYPEMAP
        Net_Config      T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL

        INPUT
        T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
                if (sv_derived_from($arg, \&quot;${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\&quot;)) {
                        IV tmp = SvIV((SV*)SvRV($arg));
                $var = ($type) tmp;
                }
                else
                        croak(\&quot;$var is not of type ${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\&quot;)

        OUTPUT
        T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
                sv_setref_pv($arg, \&quot;${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\&quot;,
                (void*)$var);
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The INPUT and OUTPUT sections substitute underscores for double-colons
on the fly, giving the desired effect.  This example demonstrates some
of the power and versatility of the typemap facility.
