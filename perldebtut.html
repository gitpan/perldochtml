perldebtut - Perl debugging tutorial
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
A (very) lightweight introduction in the use of the perl debugger, and a
pointer to existing, deeper sources of information on the subject of debugging
perl programs.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
There's an extraordinary number of people out there who don't appear to know
anything about using the perl debugger, though they use the language every
day.  
This is for them.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="use_strict">use strict</a></h2>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
First of all, there's a few things you can do to make your life a lot more
straightforward when it comes to debugging perl programs, without using the
debugger at all.  To demonstrate, here's a simple script with a problem:

	#!/usr/bin/perl

	$var1 = 'Hello World'; # always wanted to do that :-)
	$var2 = &quot;$varl\n&quot;;

	print $var2; 
	exit;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
While this compiles and runs happily, it probably won't do what's expected,
namely it doesn't print &quot;Hello World\n&quot; at all;  It will on the other hand do
exactly what it was told to do, computers being a bit that way inclined.  That
is, it will print out a newline character, and you'll get what looks like a
blank line.  It looks like there's 2 variables when (because of the typo)
there's really 3:

	$var1 = 'Hello World'
	$varl = undef
	$var2 = &quot;\n&quot;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
To catch this kind of problem, we can force each variable to be declared
before use by pulling in the strict module, by putting 'use strict;' after the
first line of the script.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Now when you run it, perl complains about the 3 undeclared variables and we
get four error messages because one variable is referenced twice:

 Global symbol &quot;$var1&quot; requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 4.
 Global symbol &quot;$var2&quot; requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 5.
 Global symbol &quot;$varl&quot; requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 5.
 Global symbol &quot;$var2&quot; requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 7.
 Execution of ./hello aborted due to compilation errors.
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Luvverly! and to fix this we declare all variables explicitly and now our
script looks like this:

	#!/usr/bin/perl
	use strict;

	my $var1 = 'Hello World';
	my $varl = '';
	my $var2 = &quot;$varl\n&quot;;

	print $var2; 
	exit;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
We then do (always a good idea) a syntax check before we try to run it again:

	&gt; perl -c hello
	hello syntax OK
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
And now when we run it, we get &quot;\n&quot; still, but at least we know why.  Just
getting this script to compile has exposed the '$varl' (with the letter 'l)
variable, and simply changing $varl to $var1 solves the problem.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="Looking_at_data_and_">Looking at data and -w and w</a></h2>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Ok, but how about when you want to really see your data, what's in that
dynamic variable, just before using it?

	#!/usr/bin/perl 
	use strict;

	my $key = 'welcome';
	my %data = (
		'this' =&gt; qw(that), 
		'tom' =&gt; qw(and jerry),
		'welcome' =&gt; q(Hello World),
		'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
	);
	my @data = keys %data;

	print &quot;$data{$key}\n&quot;;
	exit;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Looks OK, after it's been through the syntax check (perl -c scriptname), we
run it and all we get is a blank line again!  Hmmmm.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
One common debugging approach here, would be to liberally sprinkle a few print
statements, to add a check just before we print out our data, and another just
after:

	print &quot;All OK\n&quot; if grep($key, keys %data);
	print &quot;$data{$key}\n&quot;;
	print &quot;done: '$data{$key}'\n&quot;;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
And try again:

	&gt; perl data
	All OK

	done: ''
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
After much staring at the same piece of code and not seeing the wood for the
trees for some time, we get a cup of coffee and try another approach.  That
is, we bring in the cavalry by giving perl the '<b>-d</b>' switch on the command
line:

	&gt; perl -d data 
	Default die handler restored.

	Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1.07
	Editor support available.

	Enter h or `h h' for help, or `man perldebug' for more help.

	main::(./data:4):     my $key = 'welcome';
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Now, what we've done here is to launch the built-in perl debugger on our
script.  It's stopped at the first line of executable code and is waiting for
input.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Before we go any further, you'll want to know how to quit the debugger: use
just the letter '<b>q</b>', not the words 'quit' or 'exit':

	DB&lt;1&gt; q
	&gt;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
That's it, you're back on home turf again.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="help">help</a></h2>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Fire the debugger up again on your script and we'll look at the help menu. 
There's a couple of ways of calling help: a simple '<b>h</b>' will get you a long
scrolled list of help, '<b>|h</b>' (pipe-h) will pipe the help through your pager
('more' or 'less' probably), and finally, '<b>h h</b>' (h-space-h) will give you a
helpful mini-screen snapshot:

 DB&lt;1&gt; h h
 List/search source lines:               Control script execution:
 l [ln|sub]  List source code            T           Stack trace
 - or .      List previous/current line  s [expr]    Single step [in expr]

 f filename  View source in file         &lt;CR/Enter&gt;  Repeat last n or s
 /pattern/ ?patt?   Search forw/backw    r           Return from subroutine
 v           Show versions of modules    c [ln|sub]  Continue until position

</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
More confusing options than you can shake a big stick at!  It's not as bad as
it looks and it's very useful to know more about all of it, and fun too!
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
There's a couple of useful ones to know about straight away.  You wouldn't
think we're using any libraries at all at the moment, but '<b>v</b>' will show
which modules are currently loaded, by the debugger as well your script. 
'<b>V</b>' and '<b>X</b>' show variables in the program by package scope and can be
constrained by pattern.  '<b>m</b>' shows methods and '<b>S</b>' shows all subroutines
(by pattern):

	DB&lt;2&gt;S str 
	dumpvar::stringify
	strict::bits
	strict::import
	strict::unimport
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Using 'X' and cousins requires you not to use the type identifiers ($@%), just
the 'name':

	DM&lt;3&gt;X ~err
	FileHandle(stderr) =&gt; fileno(2)
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Remember we're in our tiny program with a problem, we should have a look at
where we are, and what our data looks like. First of all let's have a window
on our present position (the first line of code in this case), via the letter
'<b>w</b>':

	DB&lt;4&gt; w
	1       #!/usr/bin/perl
	2:      use strict;
	3
	4==&gt;    my $key = 'welcome';
	5:      my %data = (
	6               'this' =&gt; qw(that),
	7               'tom' =&gt; qw(and jerry),
	8               'welcome' =&gt; q(Hello World),
	9               'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
	10      );
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
At line number 4 is a helpful pointer, that tells you where you are now.  To
see more code, type 'w' again:

	DB&lt;4&gt; w
	8               'welcome' =&gt; q(Hello World),
	9               'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
	10      );
	11:     my @data = keys %data;
	12:     print &quot;All OK\n&quot; if grep($key, keys %data);
	13:     print &quot;$data{$key}\n&quot;;
	14:     print &quot;done: '$data{$key}'\n&quot;;
	15:     exit;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
And if you wanted to list line 5 again, type 'l 5', (note the space):

	DB&lt;4&gt; l 5
	5:      my %data = (
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In this case, there's not much to see, but of course normally there's pages of
stuff to wade through, and 'l' can be very useful.  To reset your view to the
line we're about to execute, type a lone period '.':

	DB&lt;5&gt; .
	main::(./data_a:4):     my $key = 'welcome';
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The line shown is the one that is about to be executed <b>next</b>, it hasn't
happened yet.  So while we can print a variable with the letter '<b>p</b>', at
this point all we'd get is an empty (undefined) value back.  What we need to
do is to step through the next executable statement with an '<b>s</b>':

	DB&lt;6&gt; s
	main::(./data_a:5):     my %data = (
	main::(./data_a:6):             'this' =&gt; qw(that),
	main::(./data_a:7):             'tom' =&gt; qw(and jerry),
	main::(./data_a:8):             'welcome' =&gt; q(Hello World),
	main::(./data_a:9):             'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
	main::(./data_a:10):    );
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Now we can have a look at that first ($key) variable:

	DB&lt;7&gt; p $key 
	welcome
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
line 13 is where the action is, so let's continue down to there via the letter
'<b>c</b>', which by the way, inserts a 'one-time-only' breakpoint at the given
line or sub routine:

	DB&lt;8&gt; c 13
	All OK
	main::(./data_a:13):    print &quot;$data{$key}\n&quot;;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
We've gone past our check (where 'All OK' was printed) and have stopped just
before the meat of our task.  We could try to print out a couple of variables
to see what is happening:

	DB&lt;9&gt; p $data{$key}
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Not much in there, lets have a look at our hash:

	DB&lt;10&gt; p %data
	Hello Worldziptomandwelcomejerrywelcomethisthat

	DB&lt;11&gt; p keys %data
	Hello Worldtomwelcomejerrythis
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Well, this isn't very easy to read, and using the helpful manual (<b>h h</b>), the
'<b>x</b>' command looks promising:

	DB&lt;12&gt; x %data
	0  'Hello World'
	1  'zip'
	2  'tom'
	3  'and'
	4  'welcome'
	5  undef
	6  'jerry'
	7  'welcome'
	8  'this'
	9  'that'
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
That's not much help, a couple of welcomes in there, but no indication of
which are keys, and which are values, it's just a listed array dump and, in
this case, not particularly helpful.  The trick here, is to use a <b>reference</b>
to the data structure:

	DB&lt;13&gt; x \%data
	0  HASH(0x8194bc4)
	   'Hello World' =&gt; 'zip'
	   'jerry' =&gt; 'welcome'
	   'this' =&gt; 'that'
	   'tom' =&gt; 'and'
	   'welcome' =&gt; undef
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The reference is truly dumped and we can finally see what we're dealing with. 
Our quoting was perfectly valid but wrong for our purposes, with 'and jerry'
being treated as 2 separate words rather than a phrase, thus throwing the
evenly paired hash structure out of alignment.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The '<b>-w</b>' switch would have told us about this, had we used it at the start,
and saved us a lot of trouble:

	&gt; perl -w data
	Odd number of elements in hash assignment at ./data line 5.
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
We fix our quoting: 'tom' =&gt; q(and jerry), and run it again, this time we get
our expected output:

	&gt; perl -w data
	Hello World
</pre>
<p></p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
While we're here, take a closer look at the '<b>x</b>' command, it's really useful
and will merrily dump out nested references, complete objects, partial objects
- just about whatever you throw at it:
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Let's make a quick object and x-plode it, first we'll start the the debugger:
it wants some form of input from STDIN, so we give it something non-commital,
a zero:

	&gt; perl -de 0
	Default die handler restored.

	Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1.07
	Editor support available.

	Enter h or `h h' for help, or `man perldebug' for more help.

	main::(-e:1):   0
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Now build an on-the-fly object over a couple of lines (note the backslash):

	DB&lt;1&gt; $obj = bless({'unique_id'=&gt;'123', 'attr'=&gt; \
	cont: 	{'col' =&gt; 'black', 'things' =&gt; [qw(this that etc)]}}, 'MY_class')
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
And let's have a look at it:

  	DB&lt;2&gt; x $obj
	0  MY_class=HASH(0x828ad98)
   		'attr' =&gt; HASH(0x828ad68)
      	'col' =&gt; 'black'
      	'things' =&gt; ARRAY(0x828abb8)
         	0  'this'
         	1  'that'
         	2  'etc'
   		'unique_id' =&gt; 123       
  	DB&lt;3&gt;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Useful, huh?  You can eval nearly anything in there, and experiment with bits
of code or regexes until the cows come home:

	DB&lt;3&gt; @data = qw(this that the other atheism leather theory scythe)

	DB&lt;4&gt; p 'saw -&gt; '.($cnt += map { print &quot;\t:\t$_\n&quot; } grep(/the/, sort @data))
	atheism
	leather
	other
	scythe
	the
	theory  
	saw -&gt; 6
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you want to see the command History, type an '<b>H</b>':

	DB&lt;5&gt; H
	4: p 'saw -&gt; '.($cnt += map { print &quot;\t:\t$_\n&quot; } grep(/the/, sort @data))
	3: @data = qw(this that the other atheism leather theory scythe)

has a problem:

Not very consistent!  We'll set a breakpoint in the code manually and run it
under the debugger to see what's going on.  A breakpoint is a flag, to which
the debugger will run without interruption, when it reaches the breakpoint, it

use, these debugger commands are completely ignored, and they are safe - if a
little messy, to leave in production code.

	main::f2c(temp:30):             my $f = shift;

	DB&lt;4&gt; w
	24:     exit;
	25
	26      sub f2c {
	27==&gt;           my $f = shift;
	28:             my $c = 5 * $f - 32 / 9; 
	29:             return $c;
	30      }
	31
	32      sub c2f {
	33:             my $c = shift;
</pre>
<p></p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Note that if there was a subroutine call between us and line 29, and we wanted
to <b>single-step</b> through it, we could use the '<b>s</b>' command, and to step
over it we would use '<b>n</b>' which would execute the sub, but not descend into
it for inspection.  In this case though, we simply continue down to line 29:

	DB&lt;4&gt; c 29  
	main::f2c(temp:29):             return $c;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
And have a look at the return value:

	DB&lt;5&gt; p $c
	162.944444444444
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This is not the right answer at all, but the sum looks correct.  I wonder if
it's anything to do with operator precedence?  We'll try a couple of other
possibilities with our sum:

	DB&lt;6&gt; p (5 * $f - 32 / 9)
	162.944444444444

	DB&lt;7&gt; p 5 * $f - (32 / 9) 
	162.944444444444

	DB&lt;8&gt; p (5 * $f) - 32 / 9
	162.944444444444

	DB&lt;9&gt; p 5 * ($f - 32) / 9
	0.722222222222221
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
:-) that's more like it!  Ok, now we can set our return variable and we'll
return out of the sub with an 'r':

	DB&lt;10&gt; $c = 5 * ($f - 32) / 9

	DB&lt;11&gt; r
	scalar context return from main::f2c: 0.722222222222221
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Looks good, let's just continue off the end of the script:

	DB&lt;12&gt; c
	0.72 c 
	Debugged program terminated.  Use q to quit or R to restart,
  	use O inhibit_exit to avoid stopping after program termination,
  	h q, h R or h O to get additional info.

Wrapping all die calls in a handler routine can be useful to see how, and from

Just a quick hint here for all those CGI programmers who can't figure out how
on earth to get past that 'waiting for input' prompt, when running their CGI

You don't have to do this all on the command line, though, there are a few GUI
options out there.  The nice thing about these is you can wave a mouse over a
variable and a dump of it's data will appear in an appropriate window, or in a
popup balloon, no more tiresome typing of 'x $varname' :-)

We've seen how to encourage good coding practices with <b>use strict</b> and

data from within the perl debugger with the <b>p</b> and <b>x</b> commands.  You can
walk through your code, set breakpoints with <b>b</b> and step through that code
with <b>s</b> or <b>n</b>, continue with <b>c</b> and return from a sub with <b>r</b>.  Fairly
intuitive stuff when you get down to it.

There is of course lots more to find out about, this has just scratched the
surface.  The best way to learn more is to use perldoc to find out more about
the language, to read the on-line help (the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perldebug.html">perldebug</a> manpage is probably the next
place to go), and of course, experiment.
