<p class="POD_TEXT">
Perl has two simple, built-in ways to open files: the shell way for
convenience, and the C way for precision.  The choice is yours.
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="Open_la_shell">Open &agrave; la shell</a></h2>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Perl's <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> function was designed to mimic the way command-line
redirection in the shell works.  Here are some basic examples
from the shell:

    $ myprogram file1 file2 file3
    $ myprogram    &lt;  inputfile
    $ myprogram    &gt;  outputfile
    $ myprogram    &gt;&gt; outputfile
    $ myprogram    |  otherprogram 
    $ otherprogram |  myprogram
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
And here are some more advanced examples:

    $ otherprogram      | myprogram f1 - f2
    $ otherprogram 2&gt;&amp;1 | myprogram -
    $ myprogram     &lt;&amp;3
    $ myprogram     &gt;&amp;4
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Programmers accustomed to constructs like those above can take comfort
in learning that Perl directly supports these familiar constructs using
virtually the same syntax as the shell.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Simple_Opens">Simple Opens</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> function takes two arguments: the first is a filehandle,
and the second is a single string comprising both what to open and how
to open it.  <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> returns true when it works, and when it fails,
returns a false value and sets the special variable $! to reflect
the system error.  If the filehandle was previously opened, it will
be implicitly closed first.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
For example:

    open(INFO,      &quot;datafile&quot;) || die(&quot;can't open datafile: $!&quot;);
    open(INFO,   &quot;&lt;  datafile&quot;) || die(&quot;can't open datafile: $!&quot;);
    open(RESULTS,&quot;&gt;  runstats&quot;) || die(&quot;can't open runstats: $!&quot;);
    open(LOG,    &quot;&gt;&gt; logfile &quot;) || die(&quot;can't open logfile:  $!&quot;);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you prefer the low-punctuation version, you could write that this way:

    open INFO,   &quot;&lt;  datafile&quot;  or die &quot;can't open datafile: $!&quot;;
    open RESULTS,&quot;&gt;  runstats&quot;  or die &quot;can't open runstats: $!&quot;;
    open LOG,    &quot;&gt;&gt; logfile &quot;  or die &quot;can't open logfile:  $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
A few things to notice.  First, the leading less-than is optional.
If omitted, Perl assumes that you want to open the file for reading.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The other important thing to notice is that, just as in the shell,
any white space before or after the filename is ignored.  This is good,
because you wouldn't want these to do different things:

    open INFO,   &quot;&lt;datafile&quot;   
    open INFO,   &quot;&lt; datafile&quot; 
    open INFO,   &quot;&lt;  datafile&quot;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Ignoring surround whitespace also helps for when you read a filename in
from a different file, and forget to trim it before opening:

    $filename = &lt;INFO&gt;;         # oops, \n still there
    open(EXTRA, &quot;&lt; $filename&quot;) || die &quot;can't open $filename: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This is not a bug, but a feature.  Because <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> mimics the shell in
its style of using redirection arrows to specify how to open the file, it
also does so with respect to extra white space around the filename itself
as well.  For accessing files with naughty names, see 
the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="#Dispelling_the_Dweom">Dispelling the Dweomer</a> elsewhere in this document.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Pipe_Opens">Pipe Opens</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In C, when you want to open a file using the standard I/O library,
you use the <code>fopen</code> function, but when opening a pipe, you use the
<code>popen</code> function.  But in the shell, you just use a different redirection
character.  That's also the case for Perl.  The <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> call 
remains the same--just its argument differs.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If the leading character is a pipe symbol, <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> starts up a new
command and open a write-only filehandle leading into that command.
This lets you write into that handle and have what you write show up on
that command's standard input.  For example:

    open(PRINTER, &quot;| lpr -Plp1&quot;)    || die &quot;cannot fork: $!&quot;;
    print PRINTER &quot;stuff\n&quot;;
    close(PRINTER)                  || die &quot;can't close lpr: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If the trailing character is a pipe, you start up a new command and open a
read-only filehandle leading out of that command.  This lets whatever that
command writes to its standard output show up on your handle for reading.
For example:

    open(NET, &quot;netstat -i -n |&quot;)    || die &quot;cannot fork: $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;NET&gt;) { }               # do something with input
    close(NET)                      || die &quot;can't close netstat: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
What happens if you try to open a pipe to or from a non-existent command?
In most systems, such an <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> will not return an error. That's
because in the traditional <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#fork">fork</a></code>/<code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#exec_PROGRAM_LIST">exec</a></code> model, running the other
program happens only in the forked child process, which means that
the failed <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#exec_PROGRAM_LIST">exec</a></code> can't be reflected in the return value of <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code>.
Only a failed <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#fork">fork</a></code> shows up there.  See 
the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfaq8.html#Why_doesn_t_open_ret">Why doesn't open() return an error when a pipe open fails?</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfaq8.html">perlfaq8</a> manpage 
to see how to cope with this.  There's also an explanation in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlipc.html">perlipc</a> manpage.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you would like to open a bidirectional pipe, the IPC::Open2
library will handle this for you.  Check out 
the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlipc.html#Bidirectional_Commun">Bidirectional Communication with Another Process</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlipc.html">perlipc</a> manpage
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_Minus_File">The Minus File</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Again following the lead of the standard shell utilities, Perl's
<code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> function treats a file whose name is a single minus, &quot;-&quot;, in a
special way.  If you open minus for reading, it really means to access
the standard input.  If you open minus for writing, it really means to
access the standard output.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If minus can be used as the default input or default output, what happens
if you open a pipe into or out of minus?  What's the default command it
would run?  The same script as you're currently running!  This is actually
a stealth <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#fork">fork</a></code> hidden inside an <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> call.  See 
the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlipc.html#Safe_Pipe_Opens">Safe Pipe Opens</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlipc.html">perlipc</a> manpage for details.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Mixing_Reads_and_Wri">Mixing Reads and Writes</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
It is possible to specify both read and write access.  All you do is
add a &quot;+&quot; symbol in front of the redirection.  But as in the shell,
using a less-than on a file never creates a new file; it only opens an
existing one.  On the other hand, using a greater-than always clobbers
(truncates to zero length) an existing file, or creates a brand-new one
if there isn't an old one.  Adding a &quot;+&quot; for read-write doesn't affect
whether it only works on existing files or always clobbers existing ones.

    open(WTMP, &quot;+&lt; /usr/adm/wtmp&quot;) 
        || die &quot;can't open /usr/adm/wtmp: $!&quot;;

    open(SCREEN, &quot;+&gt; /tmp/lkscreen&quot;)
        || die &quot;can't open /tmp/lkscreen: $!&quot;;

    open(LOGFILE, &quot;+&gt;&gt; /tmp/applog&quot;
        || die &quot;can't open /tmp/applog: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The first one won't create a new file, and the second one will always
clobber an old one.  The third one will create a new file if necessary
and not clobber an old one, and it will allow you to read at any point
in the file, but all writes will always go to the end.  In short,
the first case is substantially more common than the second and third
cases, which are almost always wrong.  (If you know C, the plus in
Perl's <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> is historically derived from the one in C's fopen(3S),
which it ultimately calls.)
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In fact, when it comes to updating a file, unless you're working on
a binary file as in the WTMP case above, you probably don't want to
use this approach for updating.  Instead, Perl's <b>-i</b> flag comes to
the rescue.  The following command takes all the C, C++, or yacc source
or header files and changes all their foo's to bar's, leaving
the old version in the original file name with a &quot;.orig&quot; tacked
on the end:

    $ perl -i.orig -pe 's/\bfoo\b/bar/g' *.[Cchy]
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This is a short cut for some renaming games that are really
the best way to update textfiles.  See the second question in 
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfaq5.html">perlfaq5</a> manpage for more details.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Filters">Filters</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
One of the most common uses for <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> is one you never
even notice.  When you process the ARGV filehandle using
<code>&lt;ARGV&gt;</code>, Perl actually does an implicit open 
on each file in @ARGV.  Thus a program called like this:

    $ myprogram file1 file2 file3
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Can have all its files opened and processed one at a time
using a construct no more complex than:

    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        # do something with $_
    }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If @ARGV is empty when the loop first begins, Perl pretends you've opened
up minus, that is, the standard input.  In fact, $ARGV, the currently
open file during <code>&lt;ARGV&gt;</code> processing, is even set to &quot;-&quot;
in these circumstances.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
You are welcome to pre-process your @ARGV before starting the loop to
make sure it's to your liking.  One reason to do this might be to remove
command options beginning with a minus.  While you can always roll the
simple ones by hand, the Getopts modules are good for this.

    use Getopt::Std;

    # -v, -D, -o ARG, sets $opt_v, $opt_D, $opt_o
    getopts(&quot;vDo:&quot;);

    # -v, -D, -o ARG, sets $args{v}, $args{D}, $args{o}
    getopts(&quot;vDo:&quot;, \%args);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Or the standard Getopt::Long module to permit named arguments:

    use Getopt::Long;
    GetOptions( &quot;verbose&quot;  =&gt; \$verbose,        # --verbose
                &quot;Debug&quot;    =&gt; \$debug,          # --Debug
                &quot;output=s&quot; =&gt; \$output );       
	    # --output=somestring or --output somestring
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Another reason for preprocessing arguments is to make an empty
argument list default to all files:

    @ARGV = glob(&quot;*&quot;) unless @ARGV;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
You could even filter out all but plain, text files.  This is a bit
silent, of course, and you might prefer to mention them on the way.

    @ARGV = grep { -f &amp;&amp; -T } @ARGV;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you're using the <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b> command-line options, you
should put changes to @ARGV in a <code>BEGIN{}</code> block.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Remember that a normal <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> has special properties, in that it might
call fopen(3S) or it might called popen(3S), depending on what its
argument looks like; that's why it's sometimes called &quot;magic open&quot;.
Here's an example:

    $pwdinfo = `domainname` =~ /^(\(none\))?$/
                    ? '&lt; /etc/passwd'
                    : 'ypcat passwd |';

    open(PWD, $pwdinfo)                 
                or die &quot;can't open $pwdinfo: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This sort of thing also comes into play in filter processing.  Because
<code>&lt;ARGV&gt;</code> processing employs the normal, shell-style Perl <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code>,
it respects all the special things we've already seen:

    $ myprogram f1 &quot;cmd1|&quot; - f2 &quot;cmd2|&quot; f3 &lt; tmpfile
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
That program will read from the file <code>f1</code>, the process <code>cmd1</code>, standard
input (<code>tmpfile</code> in this case), the <code>f2</code> file, the <code>cmd2</code> command,
and finally the <code>f3</code> file.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Yes, this also means that if you have a file named &quot;-&quot; (and so on) in
your directory, that they won't be processed as literal files by <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code>.
You'll need to pass them as &quot;./-&quot; much as you would for the <i>rm</i> program.
Or you could use <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#sysopen_FILEHANDLE_F">sysopen</a></code> as described below.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
One of the more interesting applications is to change files of a certain
name into pipes.  For example, to autoprocess gzipped or compressed
files by decompressing them with <i>gzip</i>:

    @ARGV = map { /^\.(gz|Z)$/ ? &quot;gzip -dc $_ |&quot; : $_  } @ARGV;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Or, if you have the <i>GET</i> program installed from LWP,
you can fetch URLs before processing them:

    @ARGV = map { m#^\w+://# ? &quot;GET $_ |&quot; : $_ } @ARGV;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
It's not for nothing that this is called magic <code>&lt;ARGV&gt;</code>.
Pretty nifty, eh?
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="Open_la_C">Open &agrave; la C</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you want the convenience of the shell, then Perl's <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> is
definitely the way to go.  On the other hand, if you want finer precision
than C's simplistic fopen(3S) provides, then you should look to Perl's
<code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#sysopen_FILEHANDLE_F">sysopen</a></code>, which is a direct hook into the open(2) system call.
That does mean it's a bit more involved, but that's the price of 
precision.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
<code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#sysopen_FILEHANDLE_F">sysopen</a></code> takes 3 (or 4) arguments.

    sysopen HANDLE, PATH, FLAGS, [MASK]
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The HANDLE argument is a filehandle just as with <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code>.  The PATH is
a literal path, one that doesn't pay attention to any greater-thans or
less-thans or pipes or minuses, nor ignore white space.  If it's there,
it's part of the path.  The FLAGS argument contains one or more values
derived from the Fcntl module that have been or'd together using the
bitwise &quot;|&quot; operator.  The final argument, the MASK, is optional; if
present, it is combined with the user's current umask for the creation
mode of the file.  You should usually omit this.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Although the traditional values of read-only, write-only, and read-write
are 0, 1, and 2 respectively, this is known not to hold true on some
systems.  Instead, it's best to load in the appropriate constants first
from the Fcntl module, which supplies the following standard flags:

    O_RDONLY            Read only
    O_WRONLY            Write only
    O_RDWR              Read and write
    O_CREAT             Create the file if it doesn't exist
    O_EXCL              Fail if the file already exists
    O_APPEND            Append to the file
    O_TRUNC             Truncate the file
    O_NONBLOCK          Non-blocking access
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Less common flags that are sometimes available on some operating
systems include <code>O_BINARY</code>, <code>O_TEXT</code>, <code>O_SHLOCK</code>, <code>O_EXLOCK</code>,
<code>O_DEFER</code>, <code>O_SYNC</code>, <code>O_ASYNC</code>, <code>O_DSYNC</code>, <code>O_RSYNC</code>,
<code>O_NOCTTY</code>, <code>O_NDELAY</code> and <code>O_LARGEFILE</code>.  Consult your open(2)
manpage or its local equivalent for details.  (Note: starting from
Perl release 5.6 the O_LARGEFILE flag, if available, is automatically
added to the sysopen() flags because large files are the default.)
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Here's how to use <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#sysopen_FILEHANDLE_F">sysopen</a></code> to emulate the simple <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> calls we had
before.  We'll omit the <code>|| die $!</code> checks for clarity, but make sure
you always check the return values in real code.  These aren't quite
the same, since <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> will trim leading and trailing white space,
but you'll get the idea:
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
To open a file for reading:

    open(FH, &quot;&lt; $path&quot;);
    sysopen(FH, $path, O_RDONLY);

For example, if your <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#umask">umask</a></code> were 027, then the 020 part would
disable the group from writing, and the 007 part would disable others
from reading, writing, or executing.  Under these conditions, passing
<code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#sysopen_FILEHANDLE_F">sysopen</a></code> 0666 would create a file with mode 0640, since <code>0666 &amp;~ 027</code>

<p class="POD_TEXT">
You should seldom use the MASK argument to <code>sysopen()</code>.  That takes
away the user's freedom to choose what permission new files will have.
Denying choice is almost always a bad thing.  One exception would be for
cases where sensitive or private data is being stored, such as with mail
folders, cookie files, and internal temporary files.

<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Sometimes you already have a filehandle open, and want to make another
handle that's a duplicate of the first one.  In the shell, we place an
ampersand in front of a file descriptor number when doing redirections.
For example, <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code> makes descriptor 2 (that's STDERR in Perl)
be redirected into descriptor 1 (which is usually Perl's STDOUT).
The same is essentially true in Perl: a filename that begins with an
ampersand is treated instead as a file descriptor if a number, or as a
filehandle if a string.

    open(SAVEOUT, &quot;&gt;&amp;SAVEERR&quot;) || die &quot;couldn't dup SAVEERR: $!&quot;;
    open(MHCONTEXT, &quot;&lt;&amp;4&quot;)     || die &quot;couldn't dup fd4: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
That means that if a function is expecting a filename, but you don't
want to give it a filename because you already have the file open, you
can just pass the filehandle with a leading ampersand.  It's best to
use a fully qualified handle though, just in case the function happens
to be in a different package:

    somefunction(&quot;&amp;main::LOGFILE&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This way if somefunction() is planning on opening its argument, it can
just use the already opened handle.  This differs from passing a handle,
because with a handle, you don't open the file.  Here you have something
you can pass to open.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you have one of those tricky, newfangled I/O objects that the C++
folks are raving about, then this doesn't work because those aren't a
proper filehandle in the native Perl sense.  You'll have to use fileno()
to pull out the proper descriptor number, assuming you can:

    use IO::Socket;
    $handle = IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new(&quot;www.perl.com:80&quot;);
    $fd = $handle-&gt;fileno;
    somefunction(&quot;&amp;$fd&quot;);  # not an indirect function call
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
It can be easier (and certainly will be faster) just to use real
filehandles though:

    use IO::Socket;
    local *REMOTE = IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new(&quot;www.perl.com:80&quot;);
    die &quot;can't connect&quot; unless defined(fileno(REMOTE));
    somefunction(&quot;&amp;main::REMOTE&quot;);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If the filehandle or descriptor number is preceded not just with a simple
&quot;&amp;&quot; but rather with a &quot;&amp;=&quot; combination, then Perl will not create a
completely new descriptor opened to the same place using the dup(2)
system call.  Instead, it will just make something of an alias to the
existing one using the fdopen(3S) library call  This is slightly more
parsimonious of systems resources, although this is less a concern
these days.  Here's an example of that:

    $fd = $ENV{&quot;MHCONTEXTFD&quot;};
    open(MHCONTEXT, &quot;&lt;&amp;=$fd&quot;)   or die &quot;couldn't fdopen $fd: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you're using magic <code>&lt;ARGV&gt;</code>, you could even pass in as a
command line argument in @ARGV something like <code>&quot;&lt;&amp;=$MHCONTEXTFD&quot;</code>,
but we've never seen anyone actually do this.

Perl is more of a DWIMmer language than something like Java--where DWIM
is an acronym for &quot;do what I mean&quot;.  But this principle sometimes leads
to more hidden magic than one knows what to do with.  In this way, Perl
is also filled with <i>dweomer</i>, an obscure word meaning an enchantment.
Sometimes, Perl's DWIMmer is just too much like dweomer for comfort.

<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If magic <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code> is a bit too magical for you, you don't have to turn
to <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#sysopen_FILEHANDLE_F">sysopen</a></code>.  To open a file with arbitrary weird characters in
it, it's necessary to protect any leading and trailing whitespace.
Leading whitespace is protected by inserting a <code>&quot;./&quot;</code> in front of a
filename that starts with whitespace.  Trailing whitespace is protected
by appending an ASCII NUL byte (<code>&quot;\0&quot;</code>) at the end off the string.

    $file =~ s#^(\s)#./$1#;
    open(FH, &quot;&lt; $file\0&quot;)   || die &quot;can't open $file: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This assumes, of course, that your system considers dot the current
working directory, slash the directory separator, and disallows ASCII
NULs within a valid filename.  Most systems follow these conventions,
including all POSIX systems as well as proprietary Microsoft systems.
The only vaguely popular system that doesn't work this way is the
proprietary Macintosh system, which uses a colon where the rest of us
use a slash.  Maybe <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#sysopen_FILEHANDLE_F">sysopen</a></code> isn't such a bad idea after all.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you want to use <code>&lt;ARGV&gt;</code> processing in a totally boring

    #   &quot;Sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands.  
    #   'I wish I had never come here, and I don't want to see 
    #   no more magic,' he said, and fell silent.&quot;
    for (@ARGV) {

produce messages like:

<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you don't do this, and your program fills up the disk partition due

It's probably more interesting to connect these to pipes.  For example:

This makes it appear as though your program were called with its stdout

in conjunction with an implicit fork to yourself.  You might do this
if you would rather handle the post processing in your own program,
just in a different process:

    head(100);

binary streams, to get files to behave properly you'll have to bend over
backwards to avoid nasty problems.  On such infelicitous systems, sockets

way to turn that off.  With files, you have more options.

Another option is to use the <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#binmode_FILEHANDLE">binmode</a></code> function on the appropriate

Passing <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#sysopen_FILEHANDLE_F">sysopen</a></code> a non-standard flag option will also open the file in

opening the file normally, then calling <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#binmode_FILEHANDLE">binmode</a></code>ing on the handle.

<p class="POD_TEXT">
In a multitasking environment, you may need to be careful not to collide
with other processes who want to do I/O on the same files as others
are working on.  You'll often need shared or exclusive locks
on files for reading and writing respectively.  You might just
pretend that only exclusive locks exist.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Never use the existence of a file <code>-e $file</code> as a locking indication,
because there is a race condition between the test for the existence of
the file and its creation.  Atomicity is critical.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Perl's most portable locking interface is via the <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#flock_FILEHANDLE_OPE">flock</a></code> function,
whose simplicity is emulated on systems that don't directly support it,
such as SysV or WindowsNT.  The underlying semantics may affect how
it all works, so you should learn how <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#flock_FILEHANDLE_OPE">flock</a></code> is implemented on your
system's port of Perl.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
File locking <i>does not</i> lock out another process that would like to
do I/O.  A file lock only locks out others trying to get a lock, not
processes trying to do I/O.  Because locks are advisory, if one process
uses locking and another doesn't, all bets are off.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
By default, the <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#flock_FILEHANDLE_OPE">flock</a></code> call will block until a lock is granted.
A request for a shared lock will be granted as soon as there is no
exclusive locker.  A request for a exclusive lock will be granted as
soon as there is no locker of any kind.  Locks are on file descriptors,
not file names.  You can't lock a file until you open it, and you can't
hold on to a lock once the file has been closed.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Here's how to get a blocking shared lock on a file, typically used
for reading:

    use 5.004;
    use Fcntl qw(:DEFAULT :flock);
    open(FH, &quot;&lt; filename&quot;)  or die &quot;can't open filename: $!&quot;;
    flock(FH, LOCK_SH) 	    or die &quot;can't lock filename: $!&quot;;
    # now read from FH

        or die &quot;can't lock filename: $!&quot;;

This can be useful for producing more user-friendly behaviour by warning

To get an exclusive lock, typically used for writing, you have to be
careful.  We <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#sysopen_FILEHANDLE_F">sysopen</a></code> the file so it can be locked before it gets
emptied.  You can get a nonblocking version using <code>LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB</code>.

    use Fcntl qw(:DEFAULT :flock);
    sysopen(FH, &quot;filename&quot;, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT)
