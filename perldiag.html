<pre class="POD_TEXT">
These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):

    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (optional).
    (S) A severe warning (default).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The majority of messages from the first three classifications above
(W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <code>warnings</code> pragma.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If a message can be controlled by the <code>warnings</code> pragma, its warning
category is included with the classification letter in the description
below.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Optional warnings are enabled by using the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <b>-w</b>
and <b>-W</b> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting <code>$SIG{__WARN__}</code>
to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead
of printing it.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a> manpage.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Default warnings are always enabled unless they are explicitly disabled
with the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <b>-X</b> switch.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#eval_EXPR">eval</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively
disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <code>warnings</code> pragma.
See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="warnings.html">warnings</a> manpage.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower-case.  Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are
denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape.  These escapes are
ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than
letters.  To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
letter.
</p>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="accept_on_closed_soc">accept() on closed socket %s</a>
<dd>
(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#accept_NEWSOCKET_GEN">accept</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Allocation_too_large">Allocation too large: %lx</a>
<dd>
(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_allowed_only_after_">'!' allowed only after types %s</a>
<dd>
(F) The '!' is allowed in pack() and unpack() only after certain types.
See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#pack_TEMPLATE_LIST">pack</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Ambiguous_call_resol">Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</a>
<dd>
(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling
one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's
imported with the <code>use subs</code> pragma).
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <code>CORE::</code> prefix
on the operator (e.g. <code>CORE::log($x)</code>) or by declaring the subroutine
to be an object method (see the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html#Subroutine_Attribute">Subroutine Attributes</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a> manpage or
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="attributes.html">attributes</a> manpage).
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Ambiguous_use_of_s_r">Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</a>
<dd>
(W ambiguous)(S) You said something that may not be interpreted the way
you thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying
a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_and_may_not_both_be">'|' and '&lt;' may not both be specified on command line</a>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to
redirect STDIN using '&lt;'.  Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_and_may_not_both_be1">'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</a>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and
into a pipe to another command.  You need to choose one or the other,
though nothing's stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script
which 'splits' output into two streams, such as
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;) or die &quot;Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        print;
        print OUT;
    }
    close OUT;
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Applying_s_to_s_will">Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)</a>
<dd>
(W misc) The pattern match (//), substitution (s///), and
transliteration (tr///) operators work on scalar values.  If you apply
one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to
a scalar value -- the length of an array, or the population info of a
hash -- and then work on that scalar value.  This is probably not what
you meant to do.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#grep_BLOCK_LIST">grep</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage and the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#map_EXPR_LIST">map</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage for
alternatives.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Args_must_match_line">Args must match #! line</a>
<dd>
(F) The setuid emulator requires that the arguments Perl was invoked
with match the arguments specified on the #! line.  Since some systems
impose a one-argument limit on the #! line, try combining switches;
for example, turn <code>-w -U</code> into <code>-wU</code>.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Arg_too_short_for_ms">Arg too short for msgsnd</a>
<dd>
(F) msgsnd() requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_argument_is_not_a">%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element</a>
<dd>
(F) The argument to exists() must be a hash or array element, such as:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_argument_is_not_a1">%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or slice</a>
<dd>
(F) The argument to delete() must be either a hash or array element,
such as:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
or a hash or array slice, such as:

    @foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]
    @{$ref-&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_argument_is_not_a2">%s argument is not a subroutine name</a>
<dd>
(F) The argument to exists() for <code>exists &amp;sub</code> must be a subroutine
name, and not a subroutine call.  <code>exists &amp;sub()</code> will generate this
error.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Argument_s_isn_t_num">Argument &quot;%s&quot; isn't numeric%s</a>
<dd>
(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
that expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Array_s_missing_the_">Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()</a>
<dd>
(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some
spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="assertion_botched_s">assertion botched: %s</a>
<dd>
(P) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Assertion_failed_fil">Assertion failed: file &quot;%s&quot;</a>
<dd>
(P) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Assignment_to_both_a">Assignment to both a list and a scalar</a>
<dd>
(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
must either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won't
know which context to supply to the right side.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Negative_offset_to_v">Negative offset to vec in lvalue context</a>
<dd>
(F) When vec is called in an lvalue context, the second argument must be
greater than or equal to zero.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Attempt_to_free_non_">Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%lx</a>
<dd>
(P internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas
that will be garbage collected on exit.  An SV was discovered to be
outside any of those arenas.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Attempt_to_free_none">Attempt to free nonexistent shared string</a>
<dd>
(P internal) Perl maintains a reference counted internal table of
strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other
strings.  This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count
of a string that can no longer be found in the table.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Attempt_to_free_temp">Attempt to free temp prematurely</a>
<dd>
(W debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
free_tmps() routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the
SV before the free_tmps() routine gets a chance, which means that the
free_tmps() routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does
try to free it.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Attempt_to_free_unre">Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</a>
<dd>
(P internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Attempt_to_free_unre1">Attempt to free unreferenced scalar</a>
<dd>
(W internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to
see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0
earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.
This could indicate that SvREFCNT_dec() was called too many times, or
that SvREFCNT_inc() was called too few times, or that the SV was
mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been
corrupted.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Attempt_to_join_self">Attempt to join self</a>
<dd>
(F) You tried to join a thread from within itself, which is an
impossible task.  You may be joining the wrong thread, or you may need
to move the join() to some other thread.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Attempt_to_pack_poin">Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value</a>
<dd>
(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
function, or a computed expression) to the &quot;p&quot; pack() template.  This
means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become
invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement.  Use
literals or global values as arguments to the &quot;p&quot; pack() template to
avoid this warning.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Attempt_to_use_refer">Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</a>
<dd>
(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to substr()
used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange.  Perhaps you forgot to
dereference it first.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#substr_EXPR_OFFSET_L1">substr</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bad_arg_length_for_s">Bad arg length for %s, is %d, should be %d</a>
<dd>
(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of msgctl(), semctl()
or shmctl().  In C parlance, the correct sizes are, respectively,
sizeof(struct&nbsp;msqid_ds&nbsp;*), sizeof(struct&nbsp;semid_ds&nbsp;*), and
sizeof(struct&nbsp;shmid_ds&nbsp;*).
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bad_evalled_substitu">Bad evalled substitution pattern</a>
<dd>
(F) You've used the /e switch to evaluate the replacement for a
substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the code to evaluate,
most likely an unexpected right brace '}'.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bad_filehandle_s">Bad filehandle: %s</a>
<dd>
(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the
symbol has no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn't do an
open(), or did it in another package.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bad_free_ignored">Bad free() ignored</a>
<dd>
(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something that had never
been malloc()ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled by
setting environment variable <code>PERL_BADFREE</code> to 0.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This message can be seen quite often with DB_File on systems with &quot;hard&quot;
dynamic linking, like <code>AIX</code> and <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlrun.html#OS_2">OS/2</a></code>. It is a bug of <code>Berkeley DB</code>
which is left unnoticed if <code>DB</code> uses <i>forgiving</i> system malloc().
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bad_hash">Bad hash</a>
<dd>
(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bad_index_while_coer">Bad index while coercing array into hash</a>
<dd>
(F) The index looked up in the hash found as the 0'th element of a
pseudo-hash is not legal.  Index values must be at 1 or greater.
See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlref.html">perlref</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Badly_placed_s">Badly placed ()'s</a>
<dd>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bad_name_after_s_">Bad name after %s::</a>
<dd>
(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then
didn't finish the symbol.  In particular, you can't interpolate outside
of quotes, so
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = mypack::$var;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
is not the same as

    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = &quot;mypack::$var&quot;;
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bad_realloc_ignored">Bad realloc() ignored</a>
<dd>
(S malloc) An internal routine called realloc() on something that had
never been malloc()ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled
by setting environment variable <code>PERL_BADFREE</code> to 1.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bad_symbol_for_array">Bad symbol for array</a>
<dd>
(P) An internal request asked to add an array entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bad_symbol_for_fileh">Bad symbol for filehandle</a>
<dd>
(P) An internal request asked to add a filehandle entry to something
that wasn't a symbol table entry.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bad_symbol_for_hash">Bad symbol for hash</a>
<dd>
(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bareword_found_in_co">Bareword found in conditional</a>
<dd>
(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part
of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    open FOO || die;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as
a bareword:

    use constant TYPO =&gt; 1;
    if (TYOP) { print &quot;foo&quot; }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The <code>strict</code> pragma is useful in avoiding such errors.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bareword_s_not_allow">Bareword &quot;%s&quot; not allowed while &quot;strict subs&quot; in use</a>
<dd>
(F) With &quot;strict subs&quot; in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of the &quot;=&gt;&quot;
symbol.  Perhaps you need to predeclare a subroutine?
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bareword_s_refers_to">Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers to nonexistent package</a>
<dd>
(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form <code>Foo::</code>, but the
compiler saw no other uses of that namespace before that point.  Perhaps
you need to predeclare a package?
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="BEGIN_failed_compila">BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</a>
<dd>
(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN
subroutine.  Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is
exited.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="BEGIN_not_safe_after">BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted</a>
<dd>
(F) Perl found a <code>BEGIN {}</code> subroutine (or a <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#use_Module_LIST">use</a></code> directive, which
implies a <code>BEGIN {}</code>) after one or more compilation errors had already
occurred.  Since the intended environment for the <code>BEGIN {}</code> could not
be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely
depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_1_better_written_as">\1 better written as $1</a>
<dd>
(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.
The use of backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a
substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better if
there are more than 9 backreferences.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Binary_number_0b1111">Binary number &gt; 0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable</a>
<dd>
(W portable) The binary number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlport.html">perlport</a> manpage for more on portability concerns.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="bind_on_closed_socke">bind() on closed socket %s</a>
<dd>
(W closed) You tried to do a bind on a closed socket.  Did you forget to
check the return value of your socket() call?  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#bind_SOCKET_NAME">bind</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bit_vector_size_32_n">Bit vector size &gt; 32 non-portable</a>
<dd>
(W portable) Using bit vector sizes larger than 32 is non-portable.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bizarre_copy_of_s_in">Bizarre copy of %s in %s</a>
<dd>
(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy an internal value that is not
copyable.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_P_not_allowed_for_s"><b>-P</b> not allowed for setuid/setgid script</a>
<dd>
(F) The script would have to be opened by the C preprocessor by name,
which provides a race condition that breaks security.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Buffer_overflow_in_p">Buffer overflow in prime_env_iter: %s</a>
<dd>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  While Perl was preparing to
iterate over %ENV, it encountered a logical name or symbol definition
which was too long, so it was truncated to the string shown.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Callback_called_exit">Callback called exit</a>
<dd>
(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via call_sv()
exited by calling exit.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_called_too_early_">%s() called too early to check prototype</a>
<dd>
(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the
parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
that the call conforms to the prototype.  You need to either add an
early prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype
checking.  Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the
function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid
the warning.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_cannot_take_a_count">/ cannot take a count</a>
<dd>
(F) You had an unpack template indicating a counted-length string, but
you have also specified an explicit size for the string.  See
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#pack_TEMPLATE_LIST">pack</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_bless_non_refe">Can't bless non-reference value</a>
<dd>
(F) Only hard references may be blessed.  This is how Perl &quot;enforces&quot;
encapsulation of objects.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_call_method_s_">Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; in empty package &quot;%s&quot;</a>
<dd>
(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't have ANYTHING defined
in it, let alone methods.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_call_method_s_1">Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; on an undefined value</a>
<dd>
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
object reference or package name contains an undefined value.  Something
like this will reproduce the error:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    $BADREF = undef;
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;
    $BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_call_method_s_2">Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; on unblessed reference</a>
<dd>
(F) A method call must know in what package it's supposed to run.  It
ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but you
didn't supply an object reference in this case.  A reference isn't an
object reference until it has been blessed.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_call_method_s_3">Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; without a package or object reference</a>
<dd>
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
object reference or package name contains an expression that returns a
defined value which is neither an object reference nor a package name.
Something like this will reproduce the error:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    $BADREF = 42;
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;
    $BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_chdir_to_s">Can't chdir to %s</a>
<dd>
(F) You called <code>perl -x/foo/bar</code>, but <code>/foo/bar</code> is not a directory
that you can chdir to, possibly because it doesn't exist.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_check_filesyst">Can't check filesystem of script &quot;%s&quot; for nosuid</a>
<dd>
(P) For some reason you can't check the filesystem of the script for
nosuid.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_coerce_array_i">Can't coerce array into hash</a>
<dd>
(F) You used an array where a hash was expected, but the array has no
information on how to map from keys to array indices.  You can do that
only with arrays that have a hash reference at index 0.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_coerce_s_to_in">Can't coerce %s to integer in %s</a>
<dd>
(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(typeglobs), can't be forced to stop being what they are.  So you can't
say things like:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    *foo += 1;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
You CAN say

    $foo = *foo;
    $foo += 1;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">

for other types of variables in future.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_declare_s_in_s">Can't declare %s in &quot;%s&quot;</a>
<dd>
(F) Only scalar, array, and hash variables may be declared as &quot;my&quot; or
&quot;our&quot; variables.  They must have ordinary identifiers as names.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_do_inplace_edi">Can't do inplace edit: %s is not a regular file</a>
<dd>
(S inplace) You tried to use the <b>-i</b> switch on a special file, such as
a file in /dev, or a FIFO.  The file was ignored.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_do_inplace_edi1">Can't do inplace edit on %s: %s</a>

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_do_inplace_edi2">Can't do inplace edit without backup</a>
<dd>
(F) You're on a system such as MS-DOS that gets confused if you try

<code>-i.bak</code>, or some such.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_do_inplace_edi3">Can't do inplace edit: %s would not be unique</a>
<dd>
(S inplace) Your filesystem does not support filenames longer than 14

(P) The setegid() call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator of
suidperl.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_do_seteuid_">Can't do seteuid!</a>
<dd>
(P) The setuid emulator of suidperl failed for some reason.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_do_setuid">Can't do setuid</a>
<dd>
(F) This typically means that ordinary perl tried to exec suidperl to do
setuid emulation, but couldn't exec it.  It looks for a name of the form
sperl5.000 in the same directory that the perl executable resides under
the name perl5.000, typically /usr/local/bin on Unix machines.  If the
file is there, check the execute permissions.  If it isn't, ask your
sysadmin why he and/or she removed it.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_do_waitpid_wit">Can't do waitpid with flags</a>

(F) This machine doesn't have either waitpid() or wait4(), so only
waitpid() without flags is emulated.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_emulate_s_on_l">Can't emulate -%s on #! line</a>

(F) The #! line specifies a switch that doesn't make sense at this

line.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_exec_s_s">Can't exec &quot;%s&quot;: %s</a>
<dd>
(W exec) An system(), exec(), or piped open call could not execute the
named program for the indicated reason.  Typical reasons include: the
permissions were wrong on the file, the file wasn't found in
<code>$ENV{PATH}</code>, the executable in question was compiled for another
architecture, or the #! line in a script points to an interpreter that
can't be run for similar reasons.  (Or maybe your system doesn't support
#! at all.)
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_exec_s">Can't exec %s</a>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to execute the indicated program for you because
that's what the #! line said.  If that's not what you wanted, you may
need to mention &quot;perl&quot; on the #! line somewhere.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_execute_s">Can't execute %s</a>

(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the copies of the script to execute
found in the PATH did not have correct permissions.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_find_an_opnumb">Can't find an opnumber for &quot;%s&quot;</a>

(F) A string of a form <code>CORE::word</code> was given to prototype(), but there
is no builtin with the name <code>word</code>.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_find_label_s">Can't find label %s</a>

found in the PATH.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_find_s_on_PATH1">Can't find %s on PATH, '.' not in PATH</a>

(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not be
found in the PATH, or at least not with the correct permissions.  The
script exists in the current directory, but PATH prohibits running it.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_find_string_te">Can't find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF</a>
<dd>
(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines.  This message means
that the closing delimiter was omitted.  Because bracketed quotes count
nesting levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    print q(The character '(' starts a side comment.);

(F) You may have tried to use <code>\p</code> which means a Unicode property for

<code>\\p</code> (just the <code>\p</code>) or by <code>\Q\p</code> (the rest of the string, until
possible <code>\E</code>).
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_fork">Can't fork</a>

(F) A fatal error occurred while trying to fork while opening a
pipeline.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_get_filespec_s">Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?</a>
<dd>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference
between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in
the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all
the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to
the access checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using
the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only
if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL stat() routine,
because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access checking routine gave up
and returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access checking
routine knows about the Perl <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#stat">stat</a></code> operator and file tests, so you
shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises
only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_get_pipe_mailb">Can't get pipe mailbox device name</a>
<dd>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  After creating a mailbox to act as a
pipe, Perl can't retrieve its name for later use.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_get_SYSGEN_par">Can't get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF</a>

(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl asked $GETSYI how big you want your

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_goto_into_the_">Can't &quot;goto&quot; into the middle of a foreach loop</a>
<dd>
(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump into the middle of a foreach
loop.  You can't get there from here.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#goto_EXPR">goto</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_goto_out_of_a_">Can't &quot;goto&quot; out of a pseudo block</a>
<dd>
(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump out of what might look like
a block, except that it isn't a proper block.  This usually occurs if
you tried to jump out of a sort() block or subroutine, which is a no-no.
See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#goto_EXPR">goto</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_goto_subroutin">Can't goto subroutine from an eval-string</a>
<dd>
(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can't be used to jump out of an eval
&quot;string&quot;.  (You can use it to jump out of an eval {BLOCK}, but you
probably don't want to.)
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_goto_subroutin1">Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine</a>
<dd>
(F) The deeply magical &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can only replace one
subroutine call for another.  It can't manufacture one out of whole
cloth.  In general you should be calling it out of only an AUTOLOAD
routine anyway.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#goto_EXPR">goto</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_ignore_signal_">Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</a>
<dd>
(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD
signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled.  Since disabling this
signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child
processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value.  This
situation typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_last_outside_a">Can't &quot;last&quot; outside a loop block</a>
<dd>
(F) A &quot;last&quot; statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a current
block.  Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn't count as a &quot;loopish&quot;
block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map() or grep().  You can
usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the
inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.  See
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#last">last</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_localize_lexic">Can't localize lexical variable %s</a>
<dd>
(F) You used local on a variable name that was previously declared as a
lexical variable using &quot;my&quot;.  This is not allowed.  If you want to
localize a package variable of the same name, qualify it with the
package name.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_localize_pseud">Can't localize pseudo-hash element</a>
<dd>
(F) You said something like <code>local $ar-&gt;{'key'}</code>, where $ar is a
reference to a pseudo-hash.  That hasn't been implemented yet, but you
can get a similar effect by localizing the corresponding array element
directly -- <code>local $ar-&gt;[$ar-&gt;[0]{'key'}]</code>.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_localize_throu">Can't localize through a reference</a>
<dd>
(F) You said something like <code>local $$ref</code>, which Perl can't currently
handle, because when it goes to restore the old value of whatever $ref
pointed to after the scope of the local() is finished, it can't be sure
that $ref will still be a reference.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_locate_s">Can't locate %s</a>
<dd>
(F) You said to <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#do_EXPR">do</a></code> (or <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#require">require</a></code>, or <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#use_Module_LIST">use</a></code>) a file that couldn't be
found. Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in @INC,
unless the file name included the full path to the file.  Perhaps you
need to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment variable to say where
the extra library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library name
to @INC.  Or maybe you just misspelled the name of the file.  See
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#require">require</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage and the <a class="POD_LINK" href="lib.html">lib</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_locate_auto_s_">Can't locate auto/%s.al in @INC</a>
<dd>
(F) A function (or method) was called in a package which allows
autoload, but there is no function to autoload.  Most probable causes
are a misprint in a function/method name or a failure to <code>AutoSplit</code>
the file, say, by doing <code>make install</code>.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_locate_object_">Can't locate object method &quot;%s&quot; via package &quot;%s&quot;</a>
<dd>
(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't define that particular
method, nor does any of its base classes.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_perhaps_you_forgot_">(perhaps you forgot to load &quot;%s&quot;?)</a>
<dd>
(F) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
&quot;Can't locate object method \&quot;%s\&quot; via package \&quot;%s\&quot;&quot;.  It often means
that a method requires a package that has not been loaded.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_locate_package">Can't locate package %s for @%s::ISA</a>
<dd>
(W syntax) The @ISA array contained the name of another package that
doesn't seem to exist.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_make_list_assi">Can't make list assignment to \%ENV on this system</a>
<dd>
(F) List assignment to %ENV is not supported on some systems, notably
VMS.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_modify_s_in_s">Can't modify %s in %s</a>
<dd>
(F) You aren't allowed to assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try
to change it, such as with an auto-increment.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_modify_nonexis">Can't modify nonexistent substring</a>
<dd>
(P) The internal routine that does assignment to a substr() was handed
a NULL.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_modify_non_lva">Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call</a>
<dd>
(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as
such, see the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html#Lvalue_subroutines">Lvalue subroutines</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_msgrcv_to_read">Can't msgrcv to read-only var</a>
<dd>
(F) The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable to be used as a receive
buffer.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_next_outside_a">Can't &quot;next&quot; outside a loop block</a>
<dd>
(F) A &quot;next&quot; statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn't
count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map() or
grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops
once.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#next">next</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_open_s_s">Can't open %s: %s</a>
<dd>
(S inplace) The implicit opening of a file through use of the <code>&lt;&gt;</code>
filehandle, either implicitly under the <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlrun.html#_n">-n</a></code> or <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlrun.html#_p">-p</a></code> command-line
switches, or explicitly, failed for the indicated reason.  Usually this
is because you don't have read permission for a file which you named on
the command line.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_open_bidirecti">Can't open bidirectional pipe</a>
<dd>
(W pipe) You tried to say <code>open(CMD, &quot;|cmd|&quot;)</code>, which is not supported.
You can try any of several modules in the Perl library to do this, such
as IPC::Open2.  Alternately, direct the pipe's output to a file using
&quot;&gt;&quot;, and then read it in under a different file handle.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_open_error_fil">Can't open error file %s as stderr</a>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '2&gt;' or '2&gt;&gt;' on
the command line for writing.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_open_input_fil">Can't open input file %s as stdin</a>

(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '&lt;' on the
command line for reading.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_open_output_fi">Can't open output file %s as stdout</a>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '&gt;' or '&gt;&gt;' on
the command line for writing.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_open_output_pi">Can't open output pipe (name: %s)</a>

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_open_perl_scri">Can't open perl script &quot;%s&quot;: %s</a>
<dd>
(F) The script you specified can't be opened for the indicated reason.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_read_CRTL_envi">Can't read CRTL environ</a>
<dd>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read an element of %ENV
from the CRTL's internal environment array and discovered the array was
missing.  You need to figure out where your CRTL misplaced its environ
or define <code>PERL_ENV_TABLES</code> (see the <u>perlvms</u> manpage) so that environ is not
searched.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_redefine_activ">Can't redefine active sort subroutine %s</a>
<dd>
(F) Perl optimizes the internal handling of sort subroutines and keeps
pointers into them.  You tried to redefine one such sort subroutine when
it was currently active, which is not allowed.  If you really want to do
this, you should write <code>sort { &amp;func } @x</code> instead of <code>sort func @x</code>.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_redo_outside_a">Can't &quot;redo&quot; outside a loop block</a>
<dd>
(F) A &quot;redo&quot; statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn't
count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map()
or grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that
loops once.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#redo">redo</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_remove_s_s_ski">Can't remove %s: %s, skipping file</a>
<dd>
(S inplace) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup
file.  Perl was unable to remove the original file to replace it with
the modified file.  The file was left unmodified.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_rename_s_to_s_">Can't rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file</a>
<dd>
(S inplace) The rename done by the <b>-i</b> switch failed for some reason,
probably because you don't have write permission to the directory.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_reopen_input_p">Can't reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode</a>
<dd>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried
to reopen it to accept binary data.  Alas, it failed.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_resolve_method">Can't resolve method `%s' overloading `%s' in package `%s'</a>
<dd>
(F|P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as opposed
to a subroutine reference): no such method callable via the package. If
method name is <code>???</code>, this is an internal error.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_reswap_uid_and">Can't reswap uid and euid</a>
<dd>
(P) The setreuid() call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator of
suidperl.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_return_s_from_">Can't return %s from lvalue subroutine</a>
<dd>
(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as
temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue.  This
is not allowed.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_return_s_to_lv">Can't return %s to lvalue scalar context</a>
<dd>
(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an lvalue subroutine,
but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl think you meant
to return only one value. You probably meant to write parentheses around
the call to the subroutine, which tell Perl that the call should be in
list context.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_return_outside">Can't return outside a subroutine</a>
<dd>
(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where
there was no subroutine call to return out of.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_stat_script_s_">Can't stat script &quot;%s&quot;</a>

(P) For some reason you can't fstat() the script even though you have it
open already.  Bizarre.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_swap_uid_and_e">Can't swap uid and euid</a>

(P) The setreuid() call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator of
suidperl.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_take_log_of_g">Can't take log of %g</a>
<dd>
(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the logarithm of a
negative number or zero. There's a Math::Complex package that comes
standard with Perl, though, if you really want to do that for the
negative numbers.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_take_sqrt_of_g">Can't take sqrt of %g</a>
<dd>
(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the square root of a
negative number.  There's a Math::Complex package that comes standard
with Perl, though, if you really want to do that.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_undef_active_s">Can't undef active subroutine</a>
<dd>
(F) You can't undefine a routine that's currently running.  You can,
however, redefine it while it's running, and you can even undef the
redefined subroutine while the old routine is running.  Go figure.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_unshift">Can't unshift</a>
<dd>
(F) You tried to unshift an &quot;unreal&quot; array that can't be unshifted, such
as the main Perl stack.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_upgrade_that_k">Can't upgrade that kind of scalar</a>
<dd>
(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds &quot;members&quot; to an SV, making it
into a more specialized kind of SV.  The top several SV types are so
specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted.  This message
indicates that such a conversion was attempted.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_upgrade_to_und">Can't upgrade to undef</a>
<dd>
(P) The undefined SV is the bottom of the totem pole, in the scheme of
upgradability.  Upgrading to undef indicates an error in the code
calling sv_upgrade.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_use_an_undefin">Can't use an undefined value as %s reference</a>
<dd>
(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must
be a defined value.  This helps to delurk some insidious errors.

(F) Only hard references are allowed by &quot;strict refs&quot;.  Symbolic
references are disallowed.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlref.html">perlref</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_use_because_Er">Can't use %%! because Errno.pm is not available</a>
<dd>
(F) The first time the %! hash is used, perl automatically loads the
Errno.pm module. The Errno module is expected to tie the %! hash to
provide symbolic names for <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_29">$!</a></code> errno values.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_use_s_for_loop">Can't use %s for loop variable</a>

(F) Only a simple scalar variable may be used as a loop variable on a
foreach.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_use_global_s_i">Can't use global %s in &quot;my&quot;</a>
<dd>
(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This
is not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location
(namely the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to
have variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
weren't.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_use_my_s_in_so">Can't use &quot;my %s&quot; in sort comparison</a>
<dd>
(F) The global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort comparisons.
You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator,
and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
lexical variable.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_use_s_ref_as_s">Can't use %s ref as %s ref</a>
<dd>
(F) You've mixed up your reference types.  You have to dereference a
reference of the type needed.  You can use the ref() function to
test the type of the reference, if need be.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_use_string_s_a">Can't use string (&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in use</a>

(F) Only hard references are allowed by &quot;strict refs&quot;.  Symbolic
references are disallowed.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlref.html">perlref</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_use_subscript_">Can't use subscript on %s</a>
<dd>
(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a
subscript.  But to the left of the brackets was an expression that
didn't look like an array reference, or anything else subscriptable.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_use_c_to_mean_">Can't use \%c to mean $%c in expression</a>
<dd>
(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that
creates a reference to its argument.  The use of backslash to indicate a
backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular
expression pattern.  Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a
value that prints out looking like SCALAR(0xdecaf).  Use the $1 form
instead.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_weaken_a_nonre">Can't weaken a nonreference</a>
<dd>
(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference.  Only
references can be weakened.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_x_to_read_only">Can't x= to read-only value</a>
<dd>
(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value)
with an assignment operator, which implies modifying the value itself.
Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="chmod_mode_argument_">chmod() mode argument is missing initial 0</a>
<dd>
(W chmod) A novice will sometimes say
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    chmod 777, $filename
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
not realizing that 777 will be interpreted as a decimal number,
equivalent to 01411.  Octal constants are introduced with a leading 0 in
Perl, as in C.

(W unopened) You tried to close a filehandle that was never opened.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_Command_not_found">%s: Command not found</a>

(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl.
Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl yourself.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Compilation_failed_i">Compilation failed in require</a>
<dd>
(F) Perl could not compile a file specified in a <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#require">require</a></code> statement.
Perl uses this generic message when none of the errors that it
encountered were severe enough to halt compilation immediately.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Complex_regular_sube">Complex regular subexpression recursion limit (%d) exceeded</a>
<dd>
(W regexp) The regular expression engine uses recursion in complex
situations where back-tracking is required.  Recursion depth is limited
to 32766, or perhaps less in architectures where the stack cannot grow
arbitrarily.  (&quot;Simple&quot; and &quot;medium&quot; situations are handled without
recursion and are not subject to a limit.)  Try shortening the string
under examination; looping in Perl code (e.g. with <code>while</code>) rather than
in the regular expression engine; or rewriting the regular expression so
that it is simpler or backtracks less.  (See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfaq2.html">perlfaq2</a> manpage for information
on <i>Mastering Regular Expressions</i>.)
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="connect_on_closed_so">connect() on closed socket %s</a>

(W closed) You tried to do a connect on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your socket() call?  See

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Constant_s_s_s">Constant(%s)%s: %s</a>
<dd>
(F) The parser found inconsistencies either while attempting to define
an overloaded constant, or when trying to find the character name
specified in the <code>\N{...}</code> escape.  Perhaps you forgot to load the
corresponding <code>overload</code> or <code>charnames</code> pragma?  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="charnames.html">charnames</a> manpage and
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="overload.html">overload</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Constant_is_not_s_re">Constant is not %s reference</a>
<dd>
(F) A constant value (perhaps declared using the <code>use constant</code> pragma)
is being dereferenced, but it amounts to the wrong type of reference.
The message indicates the type of reference that was expected. This
usually indicates a syntax error in dereferencing the constant value.
See the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html#Constant_Functions">Constant Functions</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a> manpage and the <a class="POD_LINK" href="constant.html">constant</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Constant_subroutine_">Constant subroutine %s redefined</a>

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Copy_method_did_not_">Copy method did not return a reference</a>

(F) An error occurred during the implicit output invoked by the <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlrun.html#_p">-p</a></code>
command-line switch.  (This output goes to STDOUT unless you've
redirected it with select().)
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_T_and_B_not_impleme"><code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlrun.html#_T">-T</a></code> and <code>-B</code> not implemented on filehandles</a>
<dd>
(F) Perl can't peek at the stdio buffer of filehandles when it doesn't
know about your kind of stdio.  You'll have to use a filename instead.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Deep_recursion_on_su">Deep recursion on subroutine &quot;%s&quot;</a>
<dd>
(W recursion) This subroutine has called itself (directly or indirectly)
100 times more than it has returned.  This probably indicates an
infinite recursion, unless you're writing strange benchmark programs, in
which case it indicates something else.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="defined_array_is_dep">defined(@array) is deprecated</a>
<dd>
(D deprecated) defined() is not usually useful on arrays because it
checks for an undefined <i>scalar</i> value.  If you want to see if the
array is empty, just use <code>if (@array) { # not empty }</code> for example.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="defined_hash_is_depr">defined(%hash) is deprecated</a>
<dd>
(D deprecated) defined() is not usually useful on hashes because it
checks for an undefined <i>scalar</i> value.  If you want to see if the hash
is empty, just use <code>if (%hash) { # not empty }</code> for example.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Delimiter_for_here_d">Delimiter for here document is too long</a>
<dd>
(F) In a here document construct like <code>&lt;&lt;FOO</code>, the label <code>FOO</code> is too
long for Perl to handle.  You have to be seriously twisted to write code
that triggers this error.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Did_not_produce_a_va">Did not produce a valid header</a>
<dd>
See Server error.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_did_not_return_a_">%s did not return a true value</a>
<dd>
(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that
it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.  It's
traditional to end such a file with a &quot;1;&quot;, though any true value would
do.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#require">require</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_Did_you_mean_s_inst">(Did you mean &amp;%s instead?)</a>

(W) You probably referred to an imported subroutine &amp;FOO as $FOO or some
such.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_Did_you_mean_local_">(Did you mean &quot;local&quot; instead of &quot;our&quot;?)</a>
<dd>
(W misc) Remember that &quot;our&quot; does not localize the declared global

seems superfluous.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_Did_you_mean_or_ins">(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?)</a>
<dd>
(W) You probably said %hash{$key} when you meant $hash{$key} or
@hash{@keys}.  On the other hand, maybe you just meant %hash and got
carried away.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Died">Died</a>
<dd>
(F) You passed die() an empty string (the equivalent of <code>die &quot;&quot;</code>) or
you called it with no args and both <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_30">$@</a></code> and <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_">$_</a></code> were empty.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Document_contains_no">Document contains no data</a>

See Server error.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Don_t_know_how_to_ha">Don't know how to handle magic of type '%s'</a>

(P) The internal handling of magical variables has been cursed.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="do_study_out_of_memo">do_study: out of memory</a>

(P) This should have been caught by safemalloc() instead.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_Do_you_need_to_pred">(Do you need to predeclare %s?)</a>
<dd>
(S) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message &quot;%s
found where operator expected&quot;.  It often means a subroutine or module
name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet.  This may be
because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
&quot;sub&quot;, &quot;package&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot; statement.  If you're referencing
something that isn't defined yet, you don't actually have to define the
subroutine or package before the current location.  You can use an empty
&quot;sub foo;&quot; or &quot;package FOO;&quot; to enter a &quot;forward&quot; declaration.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Duplicate_free_ignor">Duplicate free() ignored</a>

(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something that had
already been freed.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="elseif_should_be_els">elseif should be elsif</a>
<dd>
(S) There is no keyword &quot;elseif&quot; in Perl because Larry thinks it's ugly.
Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a method named
&quot;elseif&quot; for the class returned by the following block.  This is
unlikely to be what you want.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="entering_effective_s">entering effective %s failed</a>

(F) While under the <code>use filetest</code> pragma, switching the real and
effective uids or gids failed.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Error_converting_fil">Error converting file specification %s</a>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Because Perl may have to deal with file
specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it converts them to a
single form when it must operate on them directly.  Either you've passed
an invalid file specification to Perl, or you've found a case the
conversion routines don't handle.  Drat.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_Eval_group_in_ins">%s: Eval-group in insecure regular expression</a>

(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_Eval_group_not_al">%s: Eval-group not allowed at run time</a>
<dd>
(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the
<code>(?{ ... })</code> zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the
pattern contains interpolated values.  Since that is a security risk, it
is not allowed.  If you insist, you may still do this by explicitly
building the pattern from an interpolated string at run time and using
that in an eval().  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlre.html#_code_">(?{ code })</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlre.html">perlre</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_Eval_group_not_al1">%s: Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval'</a>

(F) A regular expression contained the <code>(?{ ... })</code> zero-width

(W regexp) A character class range must start and end at a literal
character, not another character class like <code>\d</code> or <code>[:alpha:]</code>.  The

(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Something untoward happened in a VMS
system service or RTL routine; Perl's exit status should provide more

nonzero status.  If the message indicates that the abnormal exit
resulted in a coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell) is
broken.  If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables in
config.sh:  If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as if it
were csh (e.g.  <code>full_csh='/usr/bin/tcsh'</code>); otherwise, make them all
empty (except that <code>d_csh</code> should be <code>'undef'</code>) so that Perl will
think csh is missing.  In either case, after editing config.sh, run
<code>./Configure -S</code> and rebuild Perl.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Glob_not_terminated">Glob not terminated</a>
<dd>
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a &quot;less than&quot;.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Got_an_error_from_Do">Got an error from DosAllocMem</a>
<dd>
(P) An error peculiar to OS/2.  Most probably you're using an obsolete

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="goto_must_have_label">goto must have label</a>
<dd>
(F) Unlike with &quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot;, you're not allowed to goto an
unspecified destination.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#goto_EXPR">goto</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.

(F) The final summary message when a <code>perl -c</code> fails.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Had_to_create_s_unex">Had to create %s unexpectedly</a>
<dd>
(S internal) A routine asked for a symbol from a symbol table that ought

created on an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Hash_s_missing_the_i">Hash %%s missing the % in argument %d of %s()</a>

(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the % on hash names in some

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_has_too_many_erro">%s has too many errors</a>

(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.
Further error messages would likely be uninformative.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Hexadecimal_number_0">Hexadecimal number &gt; 0xffffffff non-portable</a>
<dd>
(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1

the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlport.html">perlport</a> manpage for more on portability concerns.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Identifier_too_long">Identifier too long</a>
<dd>
(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to
about 250 characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound
names (like <code>$A::B</code>).  You've exceeded Perl's limits.  Future versions
of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Illegal_binary_digit">Illegal binary digit %s</a>
<dd>
(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Illegal_binary_digit1">Illegal binary digit %s ignored</a>
<dd>
(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a
binary number.  Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the
offending digit.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Illegal_character_s_">Illegal character %s (carriage return)</a>
<dd>
(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it
would any other whitespace, which means you should never see this error
when Perl was built using standard options.  For some reason, your
version of Perl appears to have been built without this support.  Talk
to your Perl administrator.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Illegal_division_by_">Illegal division by zero</a>
<dd>
(F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in
your logic, or you need to put a conditional in to guard against
meaningless input.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Illegal_hexadecimal_">Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored</a>
<dd>
(W digit) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or
A - F, a - f in a hexadecimal number.  Interpretation of the hexadecimal
number stopped before the illegal character.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Illegal_modulus_zero">Illegal modulus zero</a>

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Ill_formed_CRTL_envi">Ill-formed CRTL environ value &quot;%s&quot;</a>
<dd>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the CRTL's
internal environ array, and encountered an element without the <code>=</code>
delimiter used to separate keys from values.  The element is ignored.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Ill_formed_message_i">Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|</a>
<dd>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read a logical
name or CLI symbol definition when preparing to iterate over %ENV, and
didn't see the expected delimiter between key and value, so the line was
ignored.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_in_cleanup_s">(in cleanup) %s</a>
<dd>
(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a DESTROY() method raised
the indicated exception.  Since destructors are usually called by the
system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number of
times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that
would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the <code>G_KEEPERR</code> flag could
also result in this warning.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlcall.html#G_KEEPERR">G_KEEPERR</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlcall.html">perlcall</a> manpage.

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Insecure_dependency_">Insecure dependency in %s</a>
<dd>
(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism didn't like.
The tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or
setgid, or when you specify <b>-T</b> to turn it on explicitly.  The
tainting mechanism labels all data that's derived directly or indirectly
from the user, who is considered to be unworthy of your trust.  If any
such data is used in a &quot;dangerous&quot; operation, you get this error.  See

known value, using trustworthy data.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Integer_overflow_in_">Integer overflow in %s number</a>
<dd>
(W overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified
either as a literal or as an argument to hex() or oct() is too big for
your architecture, and has been converted to a floating point number.
On a 32-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number
representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively.  Note that Perl
transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation
internally--subject to loss of precision errors in subsequent
operations.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Internal_disaster_be">Internal disaster before &lt;&lt; HERE in regex m/%s/</a>

The &lt;&lt; HERE shows in the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered.
<p></p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Internal_inconsisten">Internal inconsistency in tracking vforks</a>

(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl keeps track of the number of times
you've called <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#fork">fork</a></code> and <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#exec_PROGRAM_LIST">exec</a></code>, to determine whether the current call
to <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#exec_PROGRAM_LIST">exec</a></code> should affect the current script or a subprocess (see
the section on <u>exec LIST</u> in the <u>perlvms</u> manpage).  Somehow, this count has become scrambled, so
Perl is making a guess and treating this <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#exec_PROGRAM_LIST">exec</a></code> as a request to
terminate the Perl script and execute the specified command.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Internal_urp_before_">Internal urp before &lt;&lt; HERE in regex m/%s/</a>

One possible cause for this is that you expected to have imported a
constant to your name space with <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> while no such
importing took place, it may for example be that your operating system
does not support that particular constant. Hopefully you did use an
explicit import list for the constants you expect to see, please see
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#use_Module_LIST">use</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage and the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#import">import</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage. While an explicit import list
would probably have caught this error earlier it naturally does not
remedy the fact that your operating system still does not support that
constant. Maybe you have a typo in the constants of the symbol import
list of <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> or in the constant name at the line where
this error was triggered?

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Null_filename_used">Null filename used</a>

(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with an offset
pointing outside the buffer.  This is difficult to imagine.  The sole

(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser
was expecting an operator.  The parser has assumed you really meant to
use an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect.  For

<p class="POD_TEXT">
The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it
depends on the way perl was compiled.  By default it is not trappable.
However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_M">$^M</a></code> as an
emergency pool after die()ing with this message.  In this case the error

(F) An ioctl() or fcntl() returned more than Perl was bargaining for.
Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel byte at the

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Sort_subroutine_didn">Sort subroutine didn't return a numeric value</a>

(F) A sort comparison routine must return a number.  You probably blew
it by not using <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> or <code>cmp</code>, or by not using them correctly.

Often there will be another error message associated with the syntax
error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on <b>-w</b>.)
The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
<code>perl -c</code> repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of 20&nbsp;questions.

need to rebuild Perl with a CRTL that does, or redefine

(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Unsupported_function">Unsupported function %s</a>
<dd>
(F) This machine doesn't implement the indicated function, apparently.
At least, Configure doesn't think so.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Unsupported_function1">Unsupported function fork</a>
<dd>
(F) Your version of executable does not support forking.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Note that under some systems, like OS/2, there may be different flavors
of Perl executables, some of which may support fork, some not. Try
changing the name you call Perl by to <code>perl_</code>, <code>perl__</code>, and so on.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Unsupported_script_e">Unsupported script encoding</a>
<dd>
(F) Your program file begins with a Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) which
declares it to be in a Unicode encoding that Perl cannot yet read.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Unsupported_socket_f">Unsupported socket function &quot;%s&quot; called</a>
<dd>
(F) Your machine doesn't support the Berkeley socket mechanism, or at
least that's what Configure thought.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Unterminated_attribu">Unterminated attribute list</a>
<dd>
(F) The lexer found something other than a simple identifier at the
start of an attribute, and it wasn't a semicolon or the start of a
block.  Perhaps you terminated the parameter list of the previous
attribute too soon.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="attributes.html">attributes</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Unterminated_attribu1">Unterminated attribute parameter in attribute list</a>
<dd>
(F) The lexer saw an opening (left) parenthesis character while parsing
an attribute list, but the matching closing (right) parenthesis
character was not found.  You may need to add (or remove) a backslash
character to get your parentheses to balance.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="attributes.html">attributes</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Unterminated_compres">Unterminated compressed integer</a>
<dd>
(F) An argument to unpack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was incompatible with the BER
compressed integer format and could not be converted to an integer.
See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#pack_TEMPLATE_LIST">pack</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Unterminated_operato">Unterminated &lt;&gt; operator</a>
<dd>
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a &quot;less than&quot;.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="untie_attempted_whil">untie attempted while %d inner references still exist</a>
<dd>
(W untie) A copy of the object returned from <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#tie_VARIABLE_CLASSNA">tie</a></code> (or <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#tied_VARIABLE">tied</a></code>) was
still valid when <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#untie_VARIABLE">untie</a></code> was called.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Useless_use_of_s_in_">Useless use of %s in void context</a>
<dd>
(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does
nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a
value from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator.  Very
often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl
to parse your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd
get this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and
said
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    $one, $two = 1, 2;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
when you meant to say

    ($one, $two) = (1, 2);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list
reference when you should be using square or curly brackets, for
example, if you say

    $array = (1,2);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
when you should have said

    $array = [1,2];
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value,
while parentheses do not.  So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in
a scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma operator, which
throws away the left argument, which is not what you want.  See
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlref.html">perlref</a> manpage for more on this.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Useless_use_of_re_pr">Useless use of &quot;re&quot; pragma</a>
<dd>
(W) You did <code>use re;</code> without any arguments.   That isn't very useful.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_use_not_allowed_in_">&quot;use&quot; not allowed in expression</a>
<dd>
(F) The &quot;use&quot; keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and
returns no useful value.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlmod.html">perlmod</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Use_of_bare_to_mean_">Use of bare &lt;&lt; to mean &lt;&lt;&quot;&quot; is deprecated</a>
<dd>
(D deprecated) You are now encouraged to use the explicitly quoted form
if you wish to use an empty line as the terminator of the here-document.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Use_of_implicit_spli">Use of implicit split to @_ is deprecated</a>
<dd>
(D deprecated) It makes a lot of work for the compiler when you clobber
a subroutine's argument list, so it's better if you assign the results
of a split() explicitly to an array (or list).
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Use_of_inherited_AUT">Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated</a>
<dd>
(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, <code>AUTOLOAD</code> subroutines
are looked up as methods (using the <code>@ISA</code> hierarchy) even when the
subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g.
<code>Foo::bar()</code>), not as methods (e.g. <code>Foo-&gt;bar()</code> or <code>$obj-&gt;bar()</code>).
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup only for
methods' <code>AUTOLOAD</code>s.  However, there is a significant base of existing
code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use inherited
<code>AUTOLOAD</code>s.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used
to depend on inheriting <code>AUTOLOAD</code> for non-methods from a base class
named <code>BaseClass</code>, execute <code>*AUTOLOAD = \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD</code> during
startup.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In code that currently says <code>use AutoLoader; @ISA = qw(AutoLoader);</code>
you should remove AutoLoader from @ISA and change <code>use AutoLoader;</code> to
<code>use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';</code>.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Use_of_s_in_printf_f">Use of %s in printf format not supported</a>
<dd>
(F) You attempted to use a feature of printf that is accessible from
only C.  This usually means there's a better way to do it in Perl.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Use_of_is_deprecated">Use of $* is deprecated</a>
<dd>
(D deprecated) This variable magically turned on multi-line pattern
matching, both for you and for any luckless subroutine that you happen
to call.  You should use the new <code>//m</code> and <code>//s</code> modifiers now to do
that without the dangerous action-at-a-distance effects of <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_12">$*</a></code>.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Use_of_s_is_deprecat">Use of %s is deprecated</a>
<dd>
(D deprecated) The construct indicated is no longer recommended for use,
generally because there's a better way to do it, and also because the
old way has bad side effects.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Use_of_is_deprecated1">Use of $# is deprecated</a>
<dd>
(D deprecated) This was an ill-advised attempt to emulate a poorly
defined <b>awk</b> feature.  Use an explicit printf() or sprintf() instead.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Use_of_reserved_word">Use of reserved word &quot;%s&quot; is deprecated</a>
<dd>
(D deprecated) The indicated bareword is a reserved word.  Future
versions of perl may use it as a keyword, so you're better off either
explicitly quoting the word in a manner appropriate for its context of
use, or using a different name altogether.  The warning can be
suppressed for subroutine names by either adding a <code>&amp;</code> prefix, or using
a package qualifier, e.g. <code>&amp;our()</code>, or <code>Foo::our()</code>.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Use_of_uninitialized">Use of uninitialized value%s</a>
<dd>
(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already
defined.  It was interpreted as a &quot;&quot; or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.
To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
To help you figure out what was undefined, perl tells you what operation
you used the undefined value in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your
program and the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily
appear literally in your program.  For example, <code>&quot;that $foo&quot;</code> is
usually optimized into <code>&quot;that &quot; . $foo</code>, and the warning will refer to
the <code>concatenation (.)</code> operator, even though there is no <code>.</code> in your
program.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Value_of_s_can_be_0_">Value of %s can be &quot;0&quot;; test with defined()</a>
<dd>
(W misc) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;, &lt;*&gt; (glob),
<code>each()</code>, or <code>readdir()</code> as a boolean value.  Each of these constructs
can return a value of &quot;0&quot;; that would make the conditional expression
false, which is probably not what you intended.  When using these
constructs in conditional expressions, test their values with the
<code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#defined">defined</a></code> operator.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Value_of_CLI_symbol_">Value of CLI symbol &quot;%s&quot; too long</a>
<dd>
(W misc) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the value of an
%ENV element from a CLI symbol table, and found a resultant string
longer than 1024 characters.  The return value has been truncated to
1024 characters.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Variable_s_is_not_im">Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not imported%s</a>
<dd>
(F) While &quot;use strict&quot; in effect, you referred to a global variable that
you apparently thought was imported from another module, because
something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported by
that module.  It usually means you put the wrong funny character on the
front of your variable.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_variable_s_masks_">&quot;%s&quot; variable %s masks earlier declaration in same %s</a>
<dd>
(W misc) A &quot;my&quot; or &quot;our&quot; variable has been redeclared in the current
scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the previous
instance.  This is almost always a typographical error.  Note that the
earlier variable will still exist until the end of the scope or until
all closure referents to it are destroyed.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Variable_s_may_be_un">Variable &quot;%s&quot; may be unavailable</a>
<dd>
(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>anonymous</i> subroutine is inside a
<i>named</i> subroutine, and outside that is another subroutine; and the
anonymous (innermost) subroutine is referencing a lexical variable
defined in the outermost subroutine.  For example:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
   sub outermost { my $a; sub middle { sub { $a } } }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If the anonymous subroutine is called or referenced (directly or
indirectly) from the outermost subroutine, it will share the variable as
you would expect.  But if the anonymous subroutine is called or
referenced when the outermost subroutine is not active, it will see the
value of the shared variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outermost subroutine, which is probably not what you want.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In these circumstances, it is usually best to make the middle subroutine
anonymous, using the <code>sub {}</code> syntax.  Perl has specific support for
shared variables in nested anonymous subroutines; a named subroutine in
between interferes with this feature.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Variable_syntax">Variable syntax</a>
<dd>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Variable_s_will_not_">Variable &quot;%s&quot; will not stay shared</a>
<dd>
(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a
lexical variable defined in an outer subroutine.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
When the inner subroutine is called, it will probably see the value of
the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the
outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no
longer share a common value for the variable.  In other words, the
variable will no longer be shared.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Furthermore, if the outer subroutine is anonymous and references a
lexical variable outside itself, then the outer and inner subroutines
will <i>never</i> share the given variable.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the <code>sub {}</code> syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer subroutines are called or referenced, they
are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Variable_length_look">Variable length lookbehind not implemented before &lt;&lt; HERE in %s</a>
<dd>
(F) Lookbehind is allowed only for subexpressions whose length is fixed and
known at compile time. The &lt;&lt; HERE shows in the regular expression about where
the problem was discovered.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Version_number_must_">Version number must be a constant number</a>
<dd>
(P) The attempt to translate a <code>use Module n.n LIST</code> statement into
its equivalent <code>BEGIN</code> block found an internal inconsistency with
the version number.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Warning_something_s_">Warning: something's wrong</a>
<dd>
(W) You passed warn() an empty string (the equivalent of <code>warn &quot;&quot;</code>) or
you called it with no args and <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_">$_</a></code> was empty.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Warning_unable_to_cl">Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly</a>
<dd>
(S) The implicit close() done by an open() got an error indication on
the close().  This usually indicates your file system ran out of disk
space.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Warning_Use_of_s_wit">Warning: Use of &quot;%s&quot; without parentheses is ambiguous</a>
<dd>
(S ambiguous) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that
looks like a binary operator that could also have been interpreted as a
term or unary operator.  For instance, if you know that the rand
function has a default argument of 1.0, and you write
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    rand + 5;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
you may THINK you wrote the same thing as

    rand() + 5;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
but in actual fact, you got

    rand(+5);
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
So put in parentheses to say what you really mean.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Wide_character_in_s">Wide character in %s</a>

(F) Perl met a wide character (&gt;255) when it wasn't expecting one.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="write_on_closed_file">write() on closed filehandle %s</a>

(W closed) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime
before now.  Check your logic flow.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="X_outside_of_string">X outside of string</a>
<dd>
(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position before
the beginning of the string being unpacked.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#pack_TEMPLATE_LIST">pack</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="x_outside_of_string">x outside of string</a>

(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position after
the end of the string being unpacked.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#pack_TEMPLATE_LIST">pack</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Xsub_s_called_in_sor">Xsub &quot;%s&quot; called in sort</a>

(F) The use of an external subroutine as a sort comparison is not yet
supported.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Xsub_called_in_sort">Xsub called in sort</a>

(F) The use of an external subroutine as a sort comparison is not yet

<dd>
(F) A filehandle represents an opened file, and when you opened the file
it already went past any symlink you are presumably trying to look for.
Use a filename instead.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="YOU_HAVEN_T_DISABLED">YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</a>
<dd>
(F) And you probably never will, because you probably don't have the
sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip
about what you want.  Your best bet is to use the wrapsuid script in the
eg directory to put a setuid C wrapper around your script.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="You_need_to_quote_s_">You need to quote &quot;%s&quot;</a>
<dd>
(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.
Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared,
which means that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the
assignment is executed, which is probably not what you want.  (If it IS
what you want, put an &amp; in front.)
