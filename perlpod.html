<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
A pod-to-whatever translator reads a pod file paragraph by paragraph,
and translates it to the appropriate output format.  There are
three kinds of paragraphs:
<a class="POD_LINK" href="#Verbatim_Paragraph">verbatim</a>,
<a class="POD_LINK" href="#Command_Paragraph">command</a>, and
<a class="POD_LINK" href="#Ordinary_Block_of_Te">ordinary text</a>.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Verbatim_Paragraph">Verbatim Paragraph</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
A verbatim paragraph, distinguished by being indented (that is,
it starts with space or tab).  It should be reproduced exactly,
with tabs assumed to be on 8-column boundaries.  There are no
special formatting escapes, so you can't italicize or anything
like that.  A \ means \, and nothing else.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Command_Paragraph">Command Paragraph</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
All command paragraphs start with &quot;=&quot;, followed by an
identifier, followed by arbitrary text that the command can
use however it pleases.  Currently recognized commands are

    =head1 heading
    =head2 heading
    =item text
    =over N
    =back
    =cut
    =pod
    =for X
    =begin X
    =end X
</pre>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_pod">=pod</a>
<dt><a name="_cut">=cut</a>
<dd>
The &quot;=pod&quot; directive does nothing beyond telling the compiler to lay
off parsing code through the next &quot;=cut&quot;.  It's useful for adding
another paragraph to the doc if you're mixing up code and pod a lot.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_head1">=head1</a>
<dt><a name="_head2">=head2</a>
<dd>
Head1 and head2 produce first and second level headings, with the text in
the same paragraph as the &quot;=headn&quot; directive forming the heading description.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_over">=over</a>
<dt><a name="_back">=back</a>
<dt><a name="_item">=item</a>
<dd>
Item, over, and back require a little more explanation: &quot;=over&quot; starts a
section specifically for the generation of a list using &quot;=item&quot; commands. At
the end of your list, use &quot;=back&quot; to end it. You will probably want to give
&quot;4&quot; as the number to &quot;=over&quot;, as some formatters will use this for indentation.
The unit of indentation is optional. If the unit is not given the natural
indentation of the formatting system applied will be used. Note also that
there are some basic rules to using =item: don't use them outside of 
an =over/=back block, use at least one inside an =over/=back block, you don't
_have_ to include the =back if the list just runs off the document, and
perhaps most importantly, keep the items consistent: either use &quot;=item *&quot; for
all of them, to produce bullets, or use &quot;=item 1.&quot;, &quot;=item 2.&quot;, etc., to
produce numbered lists, or use &quot;=item foo&quot;, &quot;=item bar&quot;, etc., i.e., things
that looks nothing like bullets or numbers. If you start with bullets or
numbers, stick with them, as many formatters use the first &quot;=item&quot; type to
decide how to format the list.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_for">=for</a>
<dt><a name="_begin">=begin</a>
<dt><a name="_end">=end</a>
<dd>
For, begin, and end let you include sections that are not interpreted
as pod text, but passed directly to particular formatters. A formatter
that can utilize that format will use the section, otherwise it will be
completely ignored.  The directive &quot;=for&quot; specifies that the entire next
paragraph is in the format indicated by the first word after
&quot;=for&quot;, like this:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
 =for html &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This is a raw HTML paragraph &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The paired commands &quot;=begin&quot; and &quot;=end&quot; work very similarly to &quot;=for&quot;, but
instead of only accepting a single paragraph, all text from &quot;=begin&quot; to a
paragraph with a matching &quot;=end&quot; are treated as a particular format.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Here are some examples of how to use these:

 =begin html

 &lt;br&gt;Figure 1.&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;figure1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 =end html

 =begin text

   ---------------
   |  foo        |
   |        bar  |
   ---------------

 ^^^^ Figure 1. ^^^^

 =end text
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Some format names that formatters currently are known to accept include
&quot;roff&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, &quot;latex&quot;, &quot;tex&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, and &quot;html&quot;. (Some formatters will
treat some of these as synonyms.)
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
And don't forget, when using any command, that the command lasts up until
the end of the <b>paragraph</b>, not the line. Hence in the examples below, you
can see the empty lines after each command to end its paragraph.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Some examples of lists include:

 =over 4

 =item *

 First item

 =item *

 Second item

 =back

 =over 4

 =item Foo()

 Description of Foo function

 =item Bar()

 Description of Bar function

 =back
</pre>
</dl>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Ordinary_Block_of_Te">Ordinary Block of Text</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
It will be filled, and maybe even
justified.  Certain interior sequences are recognized both
here and in commands:

    I&lt;text&gt;     Italicize text, used for emphasis or variables
    B&lt;text&gt;     Embolden text, used for switches and programs
    S&lt;text&gt;     Text contains non-breaking spaces
    C&lt;code&gt;     Render code in a typewriter font, or give some other
                indication that this represents program text
    L&lt;name&gt;     A link (cross reference) to name
		    L&lt;name&gt;		manual page
		    L&lt;name/ident&gt;	item in manual page
		    L&lt;name/&quot;sec&quot;&gt;	section in other manual page
		    L&lt;&quot;sec&quot;&gt;		section in this manual page
					(the quotes are optional)
		    L&lt;/&quot;sec&quot;&gt;		ditto
		same as above but only 'text' is used for output.
		(Text can not contain the characters '/' and '|', 
		and should contain matched '&lt;' or '&gt;')
		    L&lt;text|name&gt;
		    L&lt;text|name/ident&gt;
		    L&lt;text|name/&quot;sec&quot;&gt;
		    L&lt;text|&quot;sec&quot;&gt;
		    L&lt;text|/&quot;sec&quot;&gt;

    F&lt;file&gt;	Used for filenames
    X&lt;index&gt;	An index entry
    Z&lt;&gt;		A zero-width character
    E&lt;escape&gt;   A named character (very similar to HTML escapes)
		    E&lt;lt&gt;		A literal &lt;
		    E&lt;gt&gt;		A literal &gt;
		    E&lt;sol&gt;		A literal /
		    E&lt;verbar&gt;		A literal |
		    (these are optional except in other interior
		     sequences and when preceded by a capital letter)
		    E&lt;n&gt;		Character number n (probably in ASCII)
    	    	    E&lt;html&gt;		Some non-numeric HTML entity, such
					as E&lt;Agrave&gt;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Most of the time, you will only need a single set of angle brackets to
delimit the beginning and end of interior sequences.  However, sometimes
you will want to put a right angle bracket (or greater-than sign '&gt;')
inside of a sequence.  This is particularly common when using a sequence
to provide a different font-type for a snippet of code.  As with all
things in Perl, there is more than one way to do it.  One way is to
simply escape the closing bracket using an <code>E</code> sequence:

    C&lt;$a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b&gt;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This will produce: &quot;<code>$a &lt;=&gt; $b</code>&quot;
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
A more readable, and perhaps more &quot;plain&quot; way is to use an alternate set of
delimiters that doesn't require a &quot;&gt;&quot; to be escaped.  As of perl5.5.660,
doubled angle brackets (&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;) may be used <i>if and only if there
is whitespace immediately following the opening delimiter and immediately
preceding the closing delimiter!</i> For example, the following will do the
trick:

    C&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In fact, you can use as many repeated angle-brackets as you like so
long as you have the same number of them in the opening and closing
delimiters, and make sure that whitespace immediately follows the last
'&lt;' of the opening delimiter, and immediately precedes the first '&gt;' of
the closing delimiter.  So the following will also work:

    C&lt;&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;&gt;
    C&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This is currently supported by pod2text (Pod::Text), pod2man (Pod::Man),
and any other pod2xxx and Pod::Xxxx translator that uses Pod::Parser
1.093 or later.
</p>
<p></p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="The_Intent">The Intent</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
That's it.  The intent is simplicity, not power.  I wanted paragraphs
to look like paragraphs (block format), so that they stand out
visually, and so that I could run them through fmt easily to reformat
them (that's F7 in my version of <b>vi</b>).  I wanted the translator (and not
me) to worry about whether &quot; or ' is a left quote or a right quote
within filled text, and I wanted it to leave the quotes alone, dammit, in
verbatim mode, so I could slurp in a working program, shift it over 4
spaces, and have it print out, er, verbatim.  And presumably in a
constant width font.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In particular, you can leave things like this verbatim in your text:

    Perl
    FILEHANDLE
    $variable
    function()
    manpage(3r)
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Doubtless a few other commands or sequences will need to be added along
the way, but I've gotten along surprisingly well with just these.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Note that I'm not at all claiming this to be sufficient for producing a
book.  I'm just trying to make an idiot-proof common source for nroff,
TeX, and other markup languages, as used for online documentation.
Translators exist for <b>pod2man</b>  (that's for nroff(1) and troff(1)),
<b>pod2text</b>, <b>pod2html</b>, <b>pod2latex</b>, and <b>pod2fm</b>.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Embedding_Pods_in_Pe">Embedding Pods in Perl Modules</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
You can embed pod documentation in your Perl scripts.  Start your
documentation with a &quot;=head1&quot; command at the beginning, and end it
with a &quot;=cut&quot; command.  Perl will ignore the pod text.  See any of the
supplied library modules for examples.  If you're going to put your
pods at the end of the file, and you're using an __END__ or __DATA__
cut mark, make sure to put an empty line there before the first pod
directive.

    __END__

    =head1 NAME

    modern - I am a modern module
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you had not had that empty line there, then the translators wouldn't
have seen it.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Common_Pod_Pitfalls">Common Pod Pitfalls</a></h3>
<ul class="POD_LIST">
<li class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_"></a>

Pod translators usually will require paragraphs to be separated by
completely empty lines.  If you have an apparently empty line with
some spaces on it, this can cause odd formatting.
<li class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_1"></a>

Translators will mostly add wording around a L&lt;&gt; link, so that
<code>L&lt;foo(1)&gt;</code> becomes &quot;the <i>foo</i>(1) manpage&quot;, for example (see
<b>pod2man</b> for details).  Thus, you shouldn't write things like <code>the
L&lt;foo&gt; manpage</code>, if you want the translated document to read
sensibly.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you need total control of the text used for a link in the output
use the form L&lt;show this text|foo&gt; instead.
</p>
<li class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_2"></a>

The <b>podchecker</b> command is provided to check pod syntax
for errors and warnings. For example, it checks for completely
blank lines in pod segments and for unknown escape sequences.
It is still advised to pass it through
one or more translators and proofread the result, or print out the
result and proofread that.  Some of the problems found may be bugs in
the translators, which you may or may not wish to work around.
