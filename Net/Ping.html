<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This module contains methods to test the reachability of remote
hosts on a network.  A ping object is first created with optional
parameters, a variable number of hosts may be pinged multiple
times and then the connection is closed.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
You may choose one of three different protocols to use for the
ping. The &quot;udp&quot; protocol is the default. Note that a live remote host
may still fail to be pingable by one or more of these protocols. For
example, www.microsoft.com is generally alive but not pingable.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
With the &quot;tcp&quot; protocol the ping() method attempts to establish a
connection to the remote host's echo port.  If the connection is
successfully established, the remote host is considered reachable.  No
data is actually echoed.  This protocol does not require any special
privileges but has higher overhead than the other two protocols.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Specifying the &quot;udp&quot; protocol causes the ping() method to send a udp
packet to the remote host's echo port.  If the echoed packet is
received from the remote host and the received packet contains the
same data as the packet that was sent, the remote host is considered
reachable.  This protocol does not require any special privileges.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
It should be borne in mind that, for both tcp and udp ping, a host
will be reported as unreachable if it is not running the
appropriate echo service.  For Unix-like systems see the <u>inetd</u>(8) manpage for
more information.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If the &quot;icmp&quot; protocol is specified, the ping() method sends an icmp
echo message to the remote host, which is what the UNIX ping program
does.  If the echoed message is received from the remote host and
the echoed information is correct, the remote host is considered
reachable.  Specifying the &quot;icmp&quot; protocol requires that the program
be run as root or that the program be setuid to root.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Functions">Functions</a></h3>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Net_Ping_new_proto_d">Net::Ping-&gt;new([$proto [, $def_timeout [, $bytes]]]);</a>
<dd>
Create a new ping object.  All of the parameters are optional.  $proto
specifies the protocol to use when doing a ping.  The current choices
are &quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;udp&quot; or &quot;icmp&quot;.  The default is &quot;udp&quot;.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If a default timeout ($def_timeout) in seconds is provided, it is used
when a timeout is not given to the ping() method (below).  The timeout
must be greater than 0 and the default, if not specified, is 5 seconds.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If the number of data bytes ($bytes) is given, that many data bytes
are included in the ping packet sent to the remote host. The number of
data bytes is ignored if the protocol is &quot;tcp&quot;.  The minimum (and
default) number of data bytes is 1 if the protocol is &quot;udp&quot; and 0
otherwise.  The maximum number of data bytes that can be specified is
1024.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_p_ping_host_timeout">$p-&gt;ping($host [, $timeout]);</a>
<dd>
Ping the remote host and wait for a response.  $host can be either the
hostname or the IP number of the remote host.  The optional timeout
must be greater than 0 seconds and defaults to whatever was specified
when the ping object was created.  If the hostname cannot be found or
there is a problem with the IP number, undef is returned.  Otherwise,
1 is returned if the host is reachable and 0 if it is not.  For all
practical purposes, undef and 0 and can be treated as the same case.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_p_close_">$p-&gt;close();</a>
<dd>
Close the network connection for this ping object.  The network
connection is also closed by &quot;undef $p&quot;.  The network connection is
automatically closed if the ping object goes out of scope (e.g. $p is
local to a subroutine and you leave the subroutine).
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="pingecho_host_timeou">pingecho($host [, $timeout]);</a>
<dd>
To provide backward compatibility with the previous version of
Net::Ping, a pingecho() subroutine is available with the same
functionality as before.  pingecho() uses the tcp protocol.  The
return values and parameters are the same as described for the ping()
method.  This subroutine is obsolete and may be removed in a future
version of Net::Ping.
</dl>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="WARNING">WARNING</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
pingecho() or a ping object with the tcp protocol use alarm() to
implement the timeout.  So, don't use alarm() in your program while
you are using pingecho() or a ping object with the tcp protocol.  The
udp and icmp protocols do not use alarm() to implement the timeout.
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="NOTES">NOTES</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
There will be less network overhead (and some efficiency in your
program) if you specify either the udp or the icmp protocol.  The tcp
protocol will generate 2.5 times or more traffic for each ping than
either udp or icmp.  If many hosts are pinged frequently, you may wish
to implement a small wait (e.g. 25ms or more) between each ping to
avoid flooding your network with packets.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The icmp protocol requires that the program be run as root or that it
be setuid to root.  The tcp and udp protocols do not require special
privileges, but not all network devices implement the echo protocol
for tcp or udp.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Local hosts should normally respond to pings within milliseconds.
However, on a very congested network it may take up to 3 seconds or
longer to receive an echo packet from the remote host.  If the timeout
is set too low under these conditions, it will appear that the remote
host is not reachable (which is almost the truth).
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Reachability doesn't necessarily mean that the remote host is actually
functioning beyond its ability to echo packets.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Because of a lack of anything better, this module uses its own
routines to pack and unpack ICMP packets.  It would be better for a
separate module to be written which understands all of the different
kinds of ICMP packets.
