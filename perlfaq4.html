perlfaq4 - Data Manipulation ($Revision: 1.49 $, $Date: 1999/05/23 20:37:49 $)
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The section of the FAQ answers questions related to the manipulation
of data as numbers, dates, strings, arrays, hashes, and miscellaneous
data issues.
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="Data_Numbers">Data: Numbers</a></h2>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Why_am_I_getting_lon">Why am I getting long decimals (eg, 19.9499999999999) instead of the numbers I should be getting (eg, 19.95)?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The infinite set that a mathematician thinks of as the real numbers can
only be approximated on a computer, since the computer only has a finite
number of bits to store an infinite number of, um, numbers.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Internally, your computer represents floating-point numbers in binary.
Floating-point numbers read in from a file or appearing as literals
in your program are converted from their decimal floating-point
representation (eg, 19.95) to an internal binary representation.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
However, 19.95 can't be precisely represented as a binary
floating-point number, just like 1/3 can't be exactly represented as a
decimal floating-point number.  The computer's binary representation
of 19.95, therefore, isn't exactly 19.95.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
When a floating-point number gets printed, the binary floating-point
representation is converted back to decimal.  These decimal numbers
are displayed in either the format you specify with printf(), or the
current output format for numbers.  (See the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_20">$#</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a> manpage if you use
print.  <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_20">$#</a></code> has a different default value in Perl5 than it did in
Perl4.  Changing <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_20">$#</a></code> yourself is deprecated.)
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This affects <b>all</b> computer languages that represent decimal
floating-point numbers in binary, not just Perl.  Perl provides
arbitrary-precision decimal numbers with the Math::BigFloat module
(part of the standard Perl distribution), but mathematical operations
are consequently slower.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
To get rid of the superfluous digits, just use a format (eg,
<code>printf(&quot;%.2f&quot;, 19.95)</code>) to get the required precision.
See the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlop.html#Floating_point_Arith">Floating-point Arithmetic</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlop.html">perlop</a> manpage.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Why_isn_t_my_octal_d">Why isn't my octal data interpreted correctly?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Perl only understands octal and hex numbers as such when they occur
as literals in your program.  If they are read in from somewhere and
assigned, no automatic conversion takes place.  You must explicitly
use oct() or hex() if you want the values converted.  oct() interprets
both hex (&quot;0x350&quot;) numbers and octal ones (&quot;0350&quot; or even without the
leading &quot;0&quot;, like &quot;377&quot;), while hex() only converts hexadecimal ones,
with or without a leading &quot;0x&quot;, like &quot;0x255&quot;, &quot;3A&quot;, &quot;ff&quot;, or &quot;deadbeef&quot;.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This problem shows up most often when people try using chmod(), mkdir(),
umask(), or sysopen(), which all want permissions in octal.

    chmod(644,  $file);	# WRONG -- perl -w catches this
    chmod(0644, $file);	# right
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Does_Perl_have_a_rou">Does Perl have a round() function?  What about ceil() and floor()?  Trig functions?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Remember that int() merely truncates toward 0.  For rounding to a
certain number of digits, sprintf() or printf() is usually the easiest
route.

    printf(&quot;%.3f&quot;, 3.1415926535);	# prints 3.142
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The POSIX module (part of the standard Perl distribution) implements
ceil(), floor(), and a number of other mathematical and trigonometric
functions.

    use POSIX;
    $ceil   = ceil(3.5);			# 4
    $floor  = floor(3.5);			# 3
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In 5.000 to 5.003 perls, trigonometry was done in the Math::Complex
module.  With 5.004, the Math::Trig module (part of the standard Perl
distribution) implements the trigonometric functions. Internally it
uses the Math::Complex module and some functions can break out from
the real axis into the complex plane, for example the inverse sine of
2.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Rounding in financial applications can have serious implications, and
the rounding method used should be specified precisely.  In these
cases, it probably pays not to trust whichever system rounding is
being used by Perl, but to instead implement the rounding function you
need yourself.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
To see why, notice how you'll still have an issue on half-way-point
alternation:

    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 1.01; $i += 0.05) { printf &quot;%.1f &quot;,$i}

    0.0 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.7 
    0.8 0.8 0.9 0.9 1.0 1.0
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Don't blame Perl.  It's the same as in C.  IEEE says we have to do this.
Perl numbers whose absolute values are integers under 2**31 (on 32 bit
machines) will work pretty much like mathematical integers.  Other numbers
are not guaranteed.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_convert_bit">How do I convert bits into ints?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
To turn a string of 1s and 0s like <code>10110110</code> into a scalar containing
its binary value, use the pack() and unpack() functions (documented in
the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#pack_TEMPLATE_LIST">pack</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage and the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#unpack_TEMPLATE_EXPR">unpack</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage):

    $decimal = unpack('c', pack('B8', '10110110'));
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This packs the string <code>10110110</code> into an eight bit binary structure.
This is then unpacked as a character, which returns its ordinal value.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This does the same thing:

    $decimal = ord(pack('B8', '10110110'));
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Here's an example of going the other way:

    $binary_string = unpack('B*', &quot;\x29&quot;);
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Why_doesn_t_work_the">Why doesn't &amp; work the way I want it to?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The behavior of binary arithmetic operators depends on whether they're
used on numbers or strings.  The operators treat a string as a series
of bits and work with that (the string <code>&quot;3&quot;</code> is the bit pattern
<code>00110011</code>).  The operators work with the binary form of a number
(the number <code>3</code> is treated as the bit pattern <code>00000011</code>).
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
So, saying <code>11 &amp; 3</code> performs the &quot;and&quot; operation on numbers (yielding
<code>1</code>).  Saying <code>&quot;11&quot; &amp; &quot;3&quot;</code> performs the &quot;and&quot; operation on strings
(yielding <code>&quot;1&quot;</code>).
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Most problems with <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code> arise because the programmer thinks
they have a number but really it's a string.  The rest arise because
the programmer says:

    if (&quot;\020\020&quot; &amp; &quot;\101\101&quot;) {
	# ...
    }
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
but a string consisting of two null bytes (the result of <code>&quot;\020\020&quot;
&amp; &quot;\101\101&quot;</code>) is not a false value in Perl.  You need:

    if ( (&quot;\020\020&quot; &amp; &quot;\101\101&quot;) !~ /[^\000]/) {
	# ...
    }
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_multiply_ma">How do I multiply matrices?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Use the Math::Matrix or Math::MatrixReal modules (available from CPAN)
or the PDL extension (also available from CPAN).
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_perform_an_">How do I perform an operation on a series of integers?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
To call a function on each element in an array, and collect the
results, use:

    @results = map { my_func($_) } @array;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
For example:

    @triple = map { 3 * $_ } @single;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
To call a function on each element of an array, but ignore the
results:

    foreach $iterator (@array) {
        some_func($iterator);
    }
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
To call a function on each integer in a (small) range, you <b>can</b> use:

    @results = map { some_func($_) } (5 .. 25);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
but you should be aware that the <code>..</code> operator creates an array of
all integers in the range.  This can take a lot of memory for large
ranges.  Instead use:

    @results = ();
    for ($i=5; $i &lt; 500_005; $i++) {
        push(@results, some_func($i));
    }
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This situation has been fixed in Perl5.005. Use of <code>..</code> in a <code>for</code>
loop will iterate over the range, without creating the entire range.

    for my $i (5 .. 500_005) {
        push(@results, some_func($i));
    }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
will not create a list of 500,000 integers.

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Why_aren_t_my_random">Why aren't my random numbers random?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you're using a version of Perl before 5.004, you must call <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#srand">srand</a></code>
once at the start of your program to seed the random number generator.
5.004 and later automatically call <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#srand">srand</a></code> at the beginning.  Don't
call <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#srand">srand</a></code> more than once--you make your numbers less random, rather
than more.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Computers are good at being predictable and bad at being random
(despite appearances caused by bugs in your programs :-).
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/doc/FMTEYEWTK/random , courtesy of Tom
Phoenix, talks more about this.  John von Neumann said, ``Anyone who
attempts to generate random numbers by deterministic means is, of
course, living in a state of sin.''
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you want numbers that are more random than <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#rand">rand</a></code> with <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#srand">srand</a></code>
provides, you should also check out the Math::TrulyRandom module from
CPAN.  It uses the imperfections in your system's timer to generate
random numbers, but this takes quite a while.  If you want a better
pseudorandom generator than comes with your operating system, look at
``Numerical Recipes in C'' at http://www.nr.com/ .

<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="Data_Dates">Data: Dates</a></h2>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_find_the_we">How do I find the week-of-the-year/day-of-the-year?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The day of the year is in the array returned by localtime() (see
the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#localtime_EXPR">localtime</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage):

    $day_of_year = (localtime(time()))[7];
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
or more legibly (in 5.004 or higher):

    use Time::localtime;
    $day_of_year = localtime(time())-&gt;yday;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
You can find the week of the year by dividing this by 7:

    $week_of_year = int($day_of_year / 7);
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Of course, this believes that weeks start at zero.  The Date::Calc
module from CPAN has a lot of date calculation functions, including
day of the year, week of the year, and so on.   Note that not
all businesses consider ``week 1'' to be the same; for example,
American businesses often consider the first week with a Monday
in it to be Work Week #1, despite ISO 8601, which considers
WW1 to be the first week with a Thursday in it.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_find_the_cu">How do I find the current century or millennium?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Use the following simple functions:

    sub get_century    { 
	return int((((localtime(shift || time))[5] + 1999))/100);
    } 
    sub get_millennium { 
	return 1+int((((localtime(shift || time))[5] + 1899))/1000);
    }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
On some systems, you'll find that the POSIX module's strftime() function
has been extended in a non-standard way to use a <code>%C</code> format, which they
sometimes claim is the &quot;century&quot;.  It isn't, because on most such systems,
this is only the first two digits of the four-digit year, and thus cannot
be used to reliably determine the current century or millennium.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_can_I_compare_tw">How can I compare two dates and find the difference?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you're storing your dates as epoch seconds then simply subtract one
from the other.  If you've got a structured date (distinct year, day,
month, hour, minute, seconds values), then for reasons of accessibility,
simplicity, and efficiency, merely use either timelocal or timegm (from
the Time::Local module in the standard distribution) to reduce structured
dates to epoch seconds.  However, if you don't know the precise format of
your dates, then you should probably use either of the Date::Manip and
Date::Calc modules from CPAN before you go hacking up your own parsing
routine to handle arbitrary date formats.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_can_I_take_a_str">How can I take a string and turn it into epoch seconds?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If it's a regular enough string that it always has the same format,
you can split it up and pass the parts to <code>timelocal</code> in the standard
Time::Local module.  Otherwise, you should look into the Date::Calc
and Date::Manip modules from CPAN.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_can_I_find_the_J">How can I find the Julian Day?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Use the Time::JulianDay module (part of the Time-modules bundle
available from CPAN.)
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Before you immerse yourself too deeply in this, be sure to verify that it
is the <i>Julian</i> Day you really want.  Are you really just interested in
a way of getting serial days so that they can do date arithmetic?  If you
are interested in performing date arithmetic, this can be done using
either Date::Manip or Date::Calc, without converting to Julian Day first.

<p class="POD_TEXT">
There is too much confusion on this issue to cover in this FAQ, but the
term is applied (correctly) to a calendar now supplanted by the Gregorian
Calendar, with the Julian Calendar failing to adjust properly for leap
years on centennial years (among other annoyances).  The term is also used
(incorrectly) to mean: [1] days in the Gregorian Calendar; and [2] days
since a particular starting time or `epoch', usually 1970 in the Unix
world and 1980 in the MS-DOS/Windows world.  If you find that it is not
the first meaning that you really want, then check out the Date::Manip
and Date::Calc modules.  (Thanks to David Cassell for most of this text.)

<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The <code>time()</code> function returns the current time in seconds since the
epoch.  Take twenty-four hours off that:

    $yesterday = time() - ( 24 * 60 * 60 );
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Then you can pass this to <code>localtime()</code> and get the individual year,
month, day, hour, minute, seconds values.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Note very carefully that the code above assumes that your days are
twenty-four hours each.  For most people, there are two days a year
when they aren't: the switch to and from summer time throws this off.
A solution to this issue is offered by Russ Allbery.

    sub yesterday {
	my $now  = defined $_[0] ? $_[0] : time;
	my $then = $now - 60 * 60 * 24;
	my $ndst = (localtime $now)[8] &gt; 0;
	my $tdst = (localtime $then)[8] &gt; 0;
	$then - ($tdst - $ndst) * 60 * 60;
    }
    # Should give you &quot;this time yesterday&quot; in seconds since epoch relative to
    # the first argument or the current time if no argument is given and
    # suitable for passing to localtime or whatever else you need to do with
    # it.  $ndst is whether we're currently in daylight savings time; $tdst is
    # whether the point 24 hours ago was in daylight savings time.  If $tdst
    # and $ndst are the same, a boundary wasn't crossed, and the correction
    # will subtract 0.  If $tdst is 1 and $ndst is 0, subtract an hour more
    # from yesterday's time since we gained an extra hour while going off
    # daylight savings time.  If $tdst is 0 and $ndst is 1, subtract a
    # negative hour (add an hour) to yesterday's time since we lost an hour.
    #
    # All of this is because during those days when one switches off or onto
    # DST, a &quot;day&quot; isn't 24 hours long; it's either 23 or 25.
    #
    # The explicit settings of $ndst and $tdst are necessary because localtime
    # only says it returns the system tm struct, and the system tm struct at
    # least on Solaris doesn't guarantee any particular positive value (like,
    # say, 1) for isdst, just a positive value.  And that value can
    # potentially be negative, if DST information isn't available (this sub
    # just treats those cases like no DST).
    #
    # Note that between 2am and 3am on the day after the time zone switches
    # off daylight savings time, the exact hour of &quot;yesterday&quot; corresponding
    # to the current hour is not clearly defined.  Note also that if used
    # between 2am and 3am the day after the change to daylight savings time,
    # the result will be between 3am and 4am of the previous day; it's
    # arguable whether this is correct.

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Does_Perl_have_a_Yea">Does Perl have a Year 2000 problem?  Is Perl Y2K compliant?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Short answer: No, Perl does not have a Year 2000 problem.  Yes, Perl is
Y2K compliant (whatever that means).  The programmers you've hired to
use it, however, probably are not.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Long answer: The question belies a true understanding of the issue.
Perl is just as Y2K compliant as your pencil--no more, and no less.
Can you use your pencil to write a non-Y2K-compliant memo?  Of course
you can.  Is that the pencil's fault?  Of course it isn't.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The date and time functions supplied with Perl (gmtime and localtime)
supply adequate information to determine the year well beyond 2000
(2038 is when trouble strikes for 32-bit machines).  The year returned
by these functions when used in a list context is the year minus 1900.
For years between 1910 and 1999 this <i>happens</i> to be a 2-digit decimal
number. To avoid the year 2000 problem simply do not treat the year as
a 2-digit number.  It isn't.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
When gmtime() and localtime() are used in scalar context they return
a timestamp string that contains a fully-expanded year.  For example,
<code>$timestamp = gmtime(1005613200)</code> sets $timestamp to &quot;Tue Nov 13 01:00:00
2001&quot;.  There's no year 2000 problem here.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
That doesn't mean that Perl can't be used to create non-Y2K compliant
programs.  It can.  But so can your pencil.  It's the fault of the user,
not the language.  At the risk of inflaming the NRA: ``Perl doesn't
break Y2K, people do.''  See http://language.perl.com/news/y2k.html for
a longer exposition.

Due to the restriction of the quotes, this is a fairly complex

In the following examples, <code>$pad_len</code> is the length to which you wish

and <code>$pad_char</code> contains the padding character. You can use a single
character string constant instead of the <code>$pad_char</code> variable if you
know what it is in advance. And in the same way you can use an integer in
place of <code>$pad_len</code> if you know the pad length in advance.

<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The simplest method uses the <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#sprintf_FORMAT_LIST">sprintf</a></code> function. It can pad on the left
or right with blanks and on the left with zeroes and it will not
truncate the result. The <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#pack_TEMPLATE_LIST">pack</a></code> function can only pad strings on the
right with blanks and it will truncate the result to a maximum length of
<code>$pad_len</code>.

    # Left padding a string with blanks (no truncation):
    $padded = sprintf(&quot;%${pad_len}s&quot;, $text);

    # Right padding a string with blanks (no truncation):

If you need to pad with a character other than blank or zero you can use

Use the standard Text::Soundex module distributed with Perl.
Before you do so, you may want to determine whether `soundex' is in

two words which you might want to appear separately.  For example, the

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="What_is_the_differen">What is the difference between a list and an array?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
An array has a changeable length.  A list does not.  An array is something
you can push or pop, while a list is a set of values.  Some people make
the distinction that a list is a value while an array is a variable.
Subroutines are passed and return lists, you put things into list
context, you initialize arrays with lists, and you foreach() across
a list.  <code>@</code> variables are arrays, anonymous arrays are arrays, arrays
in scalar context behave like the number of elements in them, subroutines
access their arguments through the array <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_38">@_</a></code>, and push/pop/shift only work
on arrays.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
As a side note, there's no such thing as a list in scalar context.
When you say

    $scalar = (2, 5, 7, 9);
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
you're using the comma operator in scalar context, so it uses the scalar
comma operator.  There never was a list there at all!  This causes the
last value to be returned: 9.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="What_is_the_differen1">What is the difference between $array[1] and @array[1]?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The former is a scalar value; the latter an array slice, making
it a list with one (scalar) value.  You should use $ when you want a
scalar value (most of the time) and @ when you want a list with one
scalar value in it (very, very rarely; nearly never, in fact).
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Sometimes it doesn't make a difference, but sometimes it does.
For example, compare:

    $good[0] = `some program that outputs several lines`;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
with

    @bad[0]  = `same program that outputs several lines`;
</pre>

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_can_I_remove_dup">How can I remove duplicate elements from a list or array?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
There are several possible ways, depending on whether the array is
ordered and whether you wish to preserve the ordering.
</p>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="a_">a)</a>
<dd>
If @in is sorted, and you want @out to be sorted:
(this assumes all true values in the array)
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    $prev = &quot;not equal to $in[0]&quot;;
    @out = grep($_ ne $prev &amp;&amp; ($prev = $_, 1), @in);
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This is nice in that it doesn't use much extra memory, simulating
uniq(1)'s behavior of removing only adjacent duplicates.  The &quot;, 1&quot;
guarantees that the expression is true (so that grep picks it up)
even if the $_ is 0, &quot;&quot;, or undef.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="b_">b)</a>
<dd>
If you don't know whether @in is sorted:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    undef %saw;
    @out = grep(!$saw{$_}++, @in);
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="c_">c)</a>

<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    @out = grep(!$saw[$_]++, @in);
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="d_">d)</a>
<dd>
A way to do (b) without any loops or greps:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    undef %saw;
    @saw{@in} = ();
    @out = sort keys %saw;  # remove sort if undesired
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="e_">e)</a>
<dd>
Like (d), but @in contains only small positive integers:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    undef @ary;
    @ary[@in] = @in;
    @out = grep {defined} @ary;
</pre>

<p class="POD_TEXT">
But perhaps you should have been using a hash all along, eh?
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_can_I_tell_wheth">How can I tell whether a list or array contains a certain element?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Hearing the word &quot;in&quot; is an <i>in</i>dication that you probably should have
used a hash, not a list or array, to store your data.  Hashes are
designed to answer this question quickly and efficiently.  Arrays aren't.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
That being said, there are several ways to approach this.  If you
are going to make this query many times over arbitrary string values,
the fastest way is probably to invert the original array and keep an
associative array lying about whose keys are the first array's values.

    @blues = qw/azure cerulean teal turquoise lapis-lazuli/;
    undef %is_blue;
    for (@blues) { $is_blue{$_} = 1 }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Now you can check whether $is_blue{$some_color}.  It might have been a
good idea to keep the blues all in a hash in the first place.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If the values are all small integers, you could use a simple indexed
array.  This kind of an array will take up less space:

    @primes = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31);
    undef @is_tiny_prime;
    for (@primes) { $is_tiny_prime[$_] = 1 }
    # or simply  @istiny_prime[@primes] = (1) x @primes;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Now you check whether $is_tiny_prime[$some_number].
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If the values in question are integers instead of strings, you can save
quite a lot of space by using bit strings instead:

    @articles = ( 1..10, 150..2000, 2017 );
    undef $read;
    for (@articles) { vec($read,$_,1) = 1 }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Now check whether <code>vec($read,$n,1)</code> is true for some <code>$n</code>.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Please do not use

    ($is_there) = grep $_ eq $whatever, @array;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
or worse yet

    ($is_there) = grep /$whatever/, @array;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
These are slow (checks every element even if the first matches),
inefficient (same reason), and potentially buggy (what if there are
regex characters in $whatever?).  If you're only testing once, then
use:

    $is_there = 0;
    foreach $elt (@array) {
	if ($elt eq $elt_to_find) {
	    $is_there = 1;
	    last;

    sub compare_arrays {

For multilevel structures, you may wish to use an approach more
like this one.  It uses the CPAN module FreezeThaw:

    use FreezeThaw qw(cmpStr);
    @a = @b = ( &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, [ &quot;more&quot;, &quot;stuff&quot; ] );

	    ? &quot;the same&quot; 
	    : &quot;different&quot;;

This approach also works for comparing hashes.  Here
we'll demonstrate two different answers:

    use FreezeThaw qw(cmpStr cmpStrHard);

    %a = %b = ( &quot;this&quot; =&gt; &quot;that&quot;, &quot;extra&quot; =&gt; [ &quot;more&quot;, &quot;stuff&quot; ] );
    $a{EXTRA} = \%b;
    $b{EXTRA} = \%a;

    printf &quot;a and b contain %s hashes\n&quot;,
	cmpStr(\%a, \%b) == 0 ? &quot;the same&quot; : &quot;different&quot;;

    printf &quot;a and b contain %s hashes\n&quot;,
	cmpStrHard(\%a, \%b) == 0 ? &quot;the same&quot; : &quot;different&quot;;

In general, you usually don't need a linked list in Perl, since with
regular arrays, you can push and pop or shift and unshift at either end,
or you can use splice to add and/or remove arbitrary number of elements at
arbitrary points.  Both pop and shift are both O(1) operations on Perl's
dynamic arrays.  In the absence of shifts and pops, push in general
needs to reallocate on the order every log(N) times, and unshift will
need to copy pointers each time.

Don't do that. :-)

<p class="POD_TEXT">
[lwall] In Perl 4, you were not allowed to modify a hash at all while
iterating over it.  In Perl 5 you can delete from it, but you still
can't add to it, because that might cause a doubling of the hash table,
in which half the entries get copied up to the new top half of the
table, at which point you've totally bamboozled the iterator code.
Even if the table doesn't double, there's no telling whether your new
entry will be inserted before or after the current iterator position.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Either treasure up your changes and make them after the iterator finishes
or use keys to fetch all the old keys at once, and iterate over the list

</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If your hash could have repeated values, the methods above will only find
one of the associated keys.   This may or may not worry you.  If it does
worry you, you can always reverse the hash into a hash of arrays instead:

The keys() function also resets the iterator, which in void context is
faster for tied hashes than would be iterating through the whole

		    $hash{$a} cmp $hash{$b}

present in the array, <code>exists($key)</code> will return true.  The value for
a given key can be <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#undef">undef</a></code>, in which case <code>$array{$key}</code> will be
