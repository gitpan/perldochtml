<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This utility is designed to write a Makefile for an extension module
from a Makefile.PL. It is based on the Makefile.SH model provided by
Andy Dougherty and the perl5-porters.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
It splits the task of generating the Makefile into several subroutines
that can be individually overridden.  Each subroutine returns the text
it wishes to have written to the Makefile.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
MakeMaker is object oriented. Each directory below the current
directory that contains a Makefile.PL. Is treated as a separate
object. This makes it possible to write an unlimited number of
Makefiles with a single invocation of WriteMakefile().
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_To_Write_A_Makef">How To Write A Makefile.PL</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The short answer is: Don't.

        Always begin with h2xs.
        Always begin with h2xs!
        ALWAYS BEGIN WITH H2XS!
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
even if you're not building around a header file, and even if you
don't have an XS component.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Run h2xs(1) before you start thinking about writing a module. For so
called pm-only modules that consist of <code>*.pm</code> files only, h2xs has
the <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="../perlfunc.html#_X">-X</a></code> switch. This will generate dummy files of all kinds that are
useful for the module developer.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The medium answer is:

    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
    WriteMakefile( NAME =&gt; &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; );
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The long answer is the rest of the manpage :-)
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Default_Makefile_Beh">Default Makefile Behaviour</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The generated Makefile enables the user of the extension to invoke

  perl Makefile.PL # optionally &quot;perl Makefile.PL verbose&quot;
  make
  make test        # optionally set TEST_VERBOSE=1
  make install     # See below
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The Makefile to be produced may be altered by adding arguments of the
form <code>KEY=VALUE</code>. E.g.

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/tmp/myperl5
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Other interesting targets in the generated Makefile are

  make config     # to check if the Makefile is up-to-date
  make clean      # delete local temp files (Makefile gets renamed)
  make realclean  # delete derived files (including ./blib)
  make ci         # check in all the files in the MANIFEST file
  make dist       # see below the Distribution Support section
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="make_test">make test</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
MakeMaker checks for the existence of a file named <code>test.pl</code> in the
current directory and if it exists it adds commands to the test target
of the generated Makefile that will execute the script with the proper
set of perl <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="../perlrun.html#_Idirectory">-I</a></code> options.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
MakeMaker also checks for any files matching glob(&quot;t/*.t&quot;). It will
add commands to the test target of the generated Makefile that execute
all matching files via the the <a class="POD_LINK" href="../Test/Harness.html">Test::Harness</a> manpage module with the <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="../perlrun.html#_Idirectory">-I</a></code>
switches set correctly.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="make_testdb">make testdb</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
A useful variation of the above is the target <code>testdb</code>. It runs the
test under the Perl debugger (see the <a class="POD_LINK" href="../perldebug.html">perldebug</a> manpage). If the file
<code>test.pl</code> exists in the current directory, it is used for the test.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you want to debug some other testfile, set <code>TEST_FILE</code> variable
thusly:

  make testdb TEST_FILE=t/mytest.t
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
By default the debugger is called using <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="../perlrun.html#_d">-d</a></code> option to perl. If you
want to specify some other option, set <code>TESTDB_SW</code> variable:

  make testdb TESTDB_SW=-Dx
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="make_install">make install</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
make alone puts all relevant files into directories that are named by
the macros INST_LIB, INST_ARCHLIB, INST_SCRIPT, INST_HTMLLIBDIR,
INST_HTMLSCRIPTDIR, INST_MAN1DIR, and INST_MAN3DIR.  All these default
to something below ./blib if you are <i>not</i> building below the perl
source directory. If you <i>are</i> building below the perl source,
INST_LIB and INST_ARCHLIB default to ../../lib, and INST_SCRIPT is not
defined.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The <i>install</i> target of the generated Makefile copies the files found
below each of the INST_* directories to their INSTALL*
counterparts. Which counterparts are chosen depends on the setting of
INSTALLDIRS according to the following table:

		       	         INSTALLDIRS set to
       	       	              perl   	          site

    INST_ARCHLIB	INSTALLARCHLIB        INSTALLSITEARCH
    INST_LIB		INSTALLPRIVLIB        INSTALLSITELIB
    INST_HTMLLIBDIR	INSTALLHTMLPRIVLIBDIR INSTALLHTMLSITELIBDIR
    INST_HTMLSCRIPTDIR            INSTALLHTMLSCRIPTDIR
    INST_BIN			  INSTALLBIN
    INST_SCRIPT                   INSTALLSCRIPT
    INST_MAN1DIR                  INSTALLMAN1DIR
    INST_MAN3DIR                  INSTALLMAN3DIR
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The INSTALL... macros in turn default to their %Config
($Config{installprivlib}, $Config{installarchlib}, etc.) counterparts.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
You can check the values of these variables on your system with

    perl '-V:install.*'
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
And to check the sequence in which the library directories are
searched by perl, run

    perl -le 'print join $/, @INC'
</pre>
<p></p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="PREFIX_and_LIB_attri">PREFIX and LIB attribute</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
PREFIX and LIB can be used to set several INSTALL* attributes in one
go. The quickest way to install a module in a non-standard place might
be

    perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/lib
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This will install the module's architecture-independent files into
~/lib, the architecture-dependent files into ~/lib/$archname.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Another way to specify many INSTALL directories with a single
parameter is PREFIX.

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This will replace the string specified by <code>$Config{prefix}</code> in all
<code>$Config{install*}</code> values.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Note, that in both cases the tilde expansion is done by MakeMaker, not
by perl by default, nor by make.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Conflicts between parameters LIB,
PREFIX and the various INSTALL* arguments are resolved so that:
</p>
<ul class="POD_LIST">
<li class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_"></a>

setting LIB overrides any setting of INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB,
INSTALLSITELIB, INSTALLSITEARCH (and they are not affected by PREFIX);
<li class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_1"></a>

without LIB, setting PREFIX replaces the initial <code>$Config{prefix}</code>
part of those INSTALL* arguments, even if the latter are explicitly
set (but are set to still start with <code>$Config{prefix}</code>).
</ul>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If the user has superuser privileges, and is not working on AFS
or relatives, then the defaults for
INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB, INSTALLSCRIPT, etc. will be appropriate,
and this incantation will be the best:

    perl Makefile.PL; make; make test
    make install
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
make install per default writes some documentation of what has been
done into the file <code>$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod</code>. This feature
can be bypassed by calling make pure_install.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="AFS_users">AFS users</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
will have to specify the installation directories as these most
probably have changed since perl itself has been installed. They will
have to do this by calling

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSITELIB=/afs/here/today \
	INSTALLSCRIPT=/afs/there/now INSTALLMAN3DIR=/afs/for/manpages
    make
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Be careful to repeat this procedure every time you recompile an
extension, unless you are sure the AFS installation directories are
still valid.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Static_Linking_of_a_">Static Linking of a new Perl Binary</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
An extension that is built with the above steps is ready to use on
systems supporting dynamic loading. On systems that do not support
dynamic loading, any newly created extension has to be linked together
with the available resources. MakeMaker supports the linking process
by creating appropriate targets in the Makefile whenever an extension
is built. You can invoke the corresponding section of the makefile with

    make perl
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
That produces a new perl binary in the current directory with all
extensions linked in that can be found in INST_ARCHLIB , SITELIBEXP,
and PERL_ARCHLIB. To do that, MakeMaker writes a new Makefile, on
UNIX, this is called Makefile.aperl (may be system dependent). If you
want to force the creation of a new perl, it is recommended, that you
delete this Makefile.aperl, so the directories are searched-through
for linkable libraries again.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The binary can be installed into the directory where perl normally
resides on your machine with

    make inst_perl
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
To produce a perl binary with a different name than <code>perl</code>, either say

    perl Makefile.PL MAP_TARGET=myperl
    make myperl
    make inst_perl
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
or say

    perl Makefile.PL
    make myperl MAP_TARGET=myperl
    make inst_perl MAP_TARGET=myperl
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In any case you will be prompted with the correct invocation of the
<code>inst_perl</code> target that installs the new binary into INSTALLBIN.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
make inst_perl per default writes some documentation of what has been
done into the file <code>$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod</code>. This
can be bypassed by calling make pure_inst_perl.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Warning: the inst_perl: target will most probably overwrite your
existing perl binary. Use with care!
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Sometimes you might want to build a statically linked perl although
your system supports dynamic loading. In this case you may explicitly
set the linktype with the invocation of the Makefile.PL or make:

    perl Makefile.PL LINKTYPE=static    # recommended
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
or

    make LINKTYPE=static                # works on most systems
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Determination_of_Per">Determination of Perl Library and Installation Locations</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
MakeMaker needs to know, or to guess, where certain things are
located.  Especially INST_LIB and INST_ARCHLIB (where to put the files
during the make(1) run), PERL_LIB and PERL_ARCHLIB (where to read
existing modules from), and PERL_INC (header files and <code>libperl*.*</code>).
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Extensions may be built either using the contents of the perl source
directory tree or from the installed perl library. The recommended way
is to build extensions after you have run 'make install' on perl
itself. You can do that in any directory on your hard disk that is not
below the perl source tree. The support for extensions below the ext
directory of the perl distribution is only good for the standard
extensions that come with perl.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If an extension is being built below the <code>ext/</code> directory of the perl
source then MakeMaker will set PERL_SRC automatically (e.g.,
<code>../..</code>).  If PERL_SRC is defined and the extension is recognized as
a standard extension, then other variables default to the following:

  PERL_INC     = PERL_SRC
  PERL_LIB     = PERL_SRC/lib
  PERL_ARCHLIB = PERL_SRC/lib
  INST_LIB     = PERL_LIB
  INST_ARCHLIB = PERL_ARCHLIB
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If an extension is being built away from the perl source then MakeMaker
will leave PERL_SRC undefined and default to using the installed copy
of the perl library. The other variables default to the following:

  PERL_INC     = $archlibexp/CORE
  PERL_LIB     = $privlibexp
  PERL_ARCHLIB = $archlibexp
  INST_LIB     = ./blib/lib
  INST_ARCHLIB = ./blib/arch
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If perl has not yet been installed then PERL_SRC can be defined on the
command line as shown in the previous section.
</p>
<p></p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Which_architecture_d">Which architecture dependent directory?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you don't want to keep the defaults for the INSTALL* macros,
MakeMaker helps you to minimize the typing needed: the usual
relationship between INSTALLPRIVLIB and INSTALLARCHLIB is determined
by Configure at perl compilation time. MakeMaker supports the user who
sets INSTALLPRIVLIB. If INSTALLPRIVLIB is set, but INSTALLARCHLIB not,
then MakeMaker defaults the latter to be the same subdirectory of
INSTALLPRIVLIB as Configure decided for the counterparts in %Config ,
otherwise it defaults to INSTALLPRIVLIB. The same relationship holds
for INSTALLSITELIB and INSTALLSITEARCH.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
MakeMaker gives you much more freedom than needed to configure
internal variables and get different results. It is worth to mention,
that make(1) also lets you configure most of the variables that are
used in the Makefile. But in the majority of situations this will not
be necessary, and should only be done if the author of a package
recommends it (or you know what you're doing).
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Using_Attributes_and">Using Attributes and Parameters</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The following attributes can be specified as arguments to WriteMakefile()
or as NAME=VALUE pairs on the command line:
</p>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</a>
<dd>
One line description of the module. Will be included in PPD file.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="ABSTRACT_FROM">ABSTRACT_FROM</a>
<dd>
Name of the file that contains the package description. MakeMaker looks
for a line in the POD matching /^($package\s-\s)(.*)/. This is typically
the first line in the &quot;=head1 NAME&quot; section. $2 becomes the abstract.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="AUTHOR">AUTHOR</a>

String containing name (and email address) of package author(s). Is used
in PPD (Perl Package Description) files for PPM (Perl Package Manager).
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="BINARY_LOCATION">BINARY_LOCATION</a>
<dd>
Used when creating PPD files for binary packages.  It can be set to a
full or relative path or URL to the binary archive for a particular
architecture.  For example:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
	perl Makefile.PL BINARY_LOCATION=x86/Agent.tar.gz
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
builds a PPD package that references a binary of the <code>Agent</code> package,
located in the <code>x86</code> directory relative to the PPD itself.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="C">C</a>
<dd>
Ref to array of *.c file names. Initialised from a directory scan
and the values portion of the XS attribute hash. This is not
currently used by MakeMaker but may be handy in Makefile.PLs.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="CAPI">CAPI</a>
<dd>
[This attribute is obsolete in Perl 5.6.  PERL_OBJECT builds are C-compatible
by default.]
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Switch to force usage of the Perl C API even when compiling for PERL_OBJECT.

<dd>
String that will be included in the compiler call command line between
the arguments INC and OPTIMIZE.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="CONFIG">CONFIG</a>

NAME above.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="DL_FUNCS">DL_FUNCS</a>
<dd>
Hashref of symbol names for routines to be made available as universal
symbols.  Each key/value pair consists of the package name and an
array of routine names in that package.  Used only under AIX, OS/2,
VMS and Win32 at present.  The routine names supplied will be expanded
in the same way as XSUB names are expanded by the XS() macro.

Ref to array of executable files. The files will be copied to the
INST_SCRIPT directory. Make realclean will delete them from there
again.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="FIRST_MAKEFILE">FIRST_MAKEFILE</a>
<dd>

<dd>
Perl binary able to run this extension.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="FUNCLIST">FUNCLIST</a>
<dd>
This provides an alternate means to specify function names to be
exported from the extension.  Its value is a reference to an
array of function names to be exported by the extension.  These
names are passed through unaltered to the linker options file.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="H">H</a>
<dd>
Ref to array of *.h file names. Similar to C.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="HTMLLIBPODS">HTMLLIBPODS</a>

here will be converted to HTML format and installed as was requested
at Configure time.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="IMPORTS">IMPORTS</a>
<dd>
This attribute is used to specify names to be imported into the
extension. It is only used on OS/2 and Win32.

<dd>
Include file dirs eg: <code>&quot;-I/usr/5include -I/path/to/inc&quot;</code>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="INCLUDE_EXT">INCLUDE_EXT</a>
<dd>
Array of extension names to be included when doing a static build.
MakeMaker will normally build with all of the installed extensions when
doing a static build, and that is usually the desired behavior.  If
INCLUDE_EXT is present then MakeMaker will build only with those extensions
which are explicitly mentioned. (e.g.  [ qw( Socket POSIX ) ])
<p class="POD_TEXT">
It is not necessary to mention DynaLoader or the current extension when
filling in INCLUDE_EXT.  If the INCLUDE_EXT is mentioned but is empty then
only DynaLoader and the current extension will be included in the build.

Ref to array of typemap file names.  Use this when the typemaps are
in some directory other than the current directory or when they are
not named <b>typemap</b>.  The last typemap in the list takes

Instead of specifying the VERSION in the Makefile.PL you can let
MakeMaker parse a file to determine the version number. The parsing

<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The file named in VERSION_FROM is not added as a dependency to
Makefile. This is not really correct, but it would be a major pain
during development to have to rewrite the Makefile for any smallish
change in that file. If you want to make sure that the Makefile
contains the correct VERSION macro after any change of the file, you

If you specify COMPRESS, then SUFFIX should also be altered, as it is
needed to tell make the target file of the compression. Setting
DIST_CP to ln can be useful, if you need to preserve the timestamps on
your files. DIST_CP can take the values 'cp', which copies the file,
'ln', which links the file, and 'best' which copies symbolic links and

If you cannot achieve the desired Makefile behaviour by specifying
attributes you may define private subroutines in the Makefile.PL.
Each subroutines returns the text it wishes to have written to
the Makefile. To override a section of the Makefile you can
either say:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
	sub MY::c_o { &quot;new literal text&quot; }
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
or you can edit the default by saying something like:

	sub MY::c_o {
	    package MY;	# so that &quot;SUPER&quot; works right
	    my $inherited = shift-&gt;SUPER::c_o(@_);
	    $inherited =~ s/old text/new text/;

If you are running experiments with embedding perl as a library into

better have a look at ExtUtils::Embed which is a collection of utilities

If you still need a different solution, try to develop another

MakeMaker.pm uses the architecture specific information from

in a <code>hints/</code> directory. The hints files are expected to be named
like their counterparts in <code>PERL_SRC/hints</code>, but with an <code>.pl</code> file
name extension (eg. <code>next_3_2.pl</code>). They are simply <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="../perlfunc.html#eval_EXPR">eval</a></code>ed by
MakeMaker within the WriteMakefile() subroutine, and can be used to
execute commands as well as to include special variables. The rules
which hintsfile is chosen are the same as in Configure.

<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The hintsfile is eval()ed immediately after the arguments given to
WriteMakefile are stuffed into a hash reference $self but before this

If some events detected in <code>Makefile.PL</code> imply that there is no way
to create the Module, but this is a normal state of things, then you
can create a <code>Makefile</code> which does nothing, but succeeds on all the
&quot;usual&quot; build targets.  To do so, use

   ExtUtils::MakeMaker::WriteEmptyMakefile();
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
instead of WriteMakefile().
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This may be useful if other modules expect this module to be <i>built</i>
OK, as opposed to <i>work</i> OK (say, this system-dependent module builds
in a subdirectory of some other distribution, or is listed as a
dependency in a CPAN::Bundle, but the functionality is supported by
different means on the current architecture).
