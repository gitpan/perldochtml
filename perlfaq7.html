perlfaq7 - Perl Language Issues ($Revision: 1.28 $, $Date: 1999/05/23 20:36:18 $)
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This section deals with general Perl language issues that don't
clearly fit into any of the other sections.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Can_I_get_a_BNF_yacc">Can I get a BNF/yacc/RE for the Perl language?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
There is no BNF, but you can paw your way through the yacc grammar in
perly.y in the source distribution if you're particularly brave.  The
grammar relies on very smart tokenizing code, so be prepared to
venture into toke.c as well.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In the words of Chaim Frenkel: &quot;Perl's grammar can not be reduced to BNF.
The work of parsing perl is distributed between yacc, the lexer, smoke
and mirrors.&quot;
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="What_are_all_these_p">What are all these $@%&amp;* punctuation signs, and how do I know when to use them?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
They are type specifiers, as detailed in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perldata.html">perldata</a> manpage:

    $ for scalar values (number, string or reference)
    @ for arrays
    % for hashes (associative arrays)
    &amp; for subroutines (aka functions, procedures, methods)
    * for all types of that symbol name.  In version 4 you used them like
      pointers, but in modern perls you can just use references.
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
There are couple of other symbols that you're likely to encounter that aren't
really type specifiers:

    &lt;&gt; are used for inputting a record from a filehandle.
    \  takes a reference to something.
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Note that &lt;FILE&gt; is <i>neither</i> the type specifier for files
nor the name of the handle.  It is the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> operator applied
to the handle FILE.  It reads one line (well, record--see
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_14">$/</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a> manpage) from the handle FILE in scalar context, or <i>all</i> lines
in list context.  When performing open, close, or any other operation
besides <code>&lt;&gt;</code> on files, or even when talking about the handle, do
<i>not</i> use the brackets.  These are correct: <code>eof(FH)</code>, <code>seek(FH, 0,
2)</code> and &quot;copying from STDIN to FILE&quot;.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Do_I_always_never_ha">Do I always/never have to quote my strings or use semicolons and commas?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Normally, a bareword doesn't need to be quoted, but in most cases
probably should be (and must be under <code>use strict</code>).  But a hash key
consisting of a simple word (that isn't the name of a defined
subroutine) and the left-hand operand to the <code>=&gt;</code> operator both
count as though they were quoted:

    This                    is like this
    ------------            ---------------
    $foo{line}              $foo{&quot;line&quot;}
    bar =&gt; stuff            &quot;bar&quot; =&gt; stuff
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The final semicolon in a block is optional, as is the final comma in a
list.  Good style (see the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlstyle.html">perlstyle</a> manpage) says to put them in except for
one-liners:

    if ($whoops) { exit 1 }
    @nums = (1, 2, 3);

    if ($whoops) {
        exit 1;
    }
    @lines = (
	&quot;There Beren came from mountains cold&quot;,
	&quot;And lost he wandered under leaves&quot;,
    );
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_skip_some_r">How do I skip some return values?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
One way is to treat the return values as a list and index into it:

        $dir = (getpwnam($user))[7];
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Another way is to use undef as an element on the left-hand-side:

    ($dev, $ino, undef, undef, $uid, $gid) = stat($file);
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_temporarily">How do I temporarily block warnings?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you are running Perl 5.6.0 or better, the <code>use warnings</code> pragma
allows fine control of what warning are produced.
See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perllexwarn.html">perllexwarn</a> manpage for more details.

    {
	no warnings;          # temporarily turn off warnings
	$a = $b + $c;         # I know these might be undef
    }
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you have an older version of Perl, the <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_W">$^W</a></code> variable (documented
in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a> manpage) controls runtime warnings for a block:

    {
	local $^W = 0;        # temporarily turn off warnings
	$a = $b + $c;         # I know these might be undef
    }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Note that like all the punctuation variables, you cannot currently
use my() on <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_W">$^W</a></code>, only local().
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="What_s_an_extension_">What's an extension?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
An extension is a way of calling compiled C code from Perl.  Reading
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlxstut.html">perlxstut</a> manpage is a good place to learn more about extensions.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Why_do_Perl_operator">Why do Perl operators have different precedence than C operators?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Actually, they don't.  All C operators that Perl copies have the same
precedence in Perl as they do in C.  The problem is with operators that C
doesn't have, especially functions that give a list context to everything
on their right, eg. print, chmod, exec, and so on.  Such functions are
called &quot;list operators&quot; and appear as such in the precedence table in
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlop.html">perlop</a> manpage.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
A common mistake is to write:

    unlink $file || die &quot;snafu&quot;;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This gets interpreted as:

    unlink ($file || die &quot;snafu&quot;);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
To avoid this problem, either put in extra parentheses or use the
super low precedence <code>or</code> operator:

    (unlink $file) || die &quot;snafu&quot;;
    unlink $file or die &quot;snafu&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The &quot;English&quot; operators (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>not</code>)
deliberately have precedence lower than that of list operators for
just such situations as the one above.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Another operator with surprising precedence is exponentiation.  It
binds more tightly even than unary minus, making <code>-2**2</code> product a
negative not a positive four.  It is also right-associating, meaning
that <code>2**3**2</code> is two raised to the ninth power, not eight squared.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Although it has the same precedence as in C, Perl's <code>?:</code> operator
produces an lvalue.  This assigns $x to either $a or $b, depending
on the trueness of $maybe:

    ($maybe ? $a : $b) = $x;
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_declare_cre">How do I declare/create a structure?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In general, you don't &quot;declare&quot; a structure.  Just use a (probably
anonymous) hash reference.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlref.html">perlref</a> manpage and the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perldsc.html">perldsc</a> manpage for details.
Here's an example:

    $person = {};                   # new anonymous hash
    $person-&gt;{AGE}  = 24;           # set field AGE to 24
    $person-&gt;{NAME} = &quot;Nat&quot;;        # set field NAME to &quot;Nat&quot;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you're looking for something a bit more rigorous, try the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perltoot.html">perltoot</a> manpage.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_create_a_mo">How do I create a module?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
A module is a package that lives in a file of the same name.  For
example, the Hello::There module would live in Hello/There.pm.  For
details, read the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlmod.html">perlmod</a> manpage.  You'll also find the <a class="POD_LINK" href="Exporter.html">Exporter</a> manpage helpful.  If
you're writing a C or mixed-language module with both C and Perl, then
you should study the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlxstut.html">perlxstut</a> manpage.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Here's a convenient template you might wish you use when starting your
own module.  Make sure to change the names appropriately.

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    $Var1   = '';
    %Hashit = ();

    # then the others (which are still accessible as $Some::Module::stuff)
    $stuff  = '';
    @more   = ();

    # all file-scoped lexicals must be created before
    # the functions below that use them.

    # file-private lexicals go here
    my $priv_var    = '';
    my %secret_hash = ();

    # here's a file-private function as a closure,
    # callable as &amp;$priv_func;  it cannot be prototyped.
    my $priv_func = sub {
        # stuff goes here.
    };

    # make all your functions, whether exported or not;
    # remember to put something interesting in the {} stubs
    sub func1      {}	 # no prototype
    sub func2()    {}	 # proto'd void
    sub func3($$)  {}	 # proto'd to 2 scalars

    # this one isn't exported, but could be called!
    sub func4(\%)  {}    # proto'd to 1 hash ref

    END { }       # module clean-up code here (global destructor)

    1;            # modules must return true

example (which doesn't use any system calls, because the kill()

    sub is_tainted {
	return ! eval { join('',@_), kill 0; 1; };
    }

detect taintedness--take this as a hint that you should untaint
all possibly-tainted data.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="What_s_a_closure_">What's a closure?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Closures are documented in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlref.html">perlref</a> manpage.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
<i>Closure</i> is a computer science term with a precise but
hard-to-explain meaning. Closures are implemented in Perl as anonymous
subroutines with lasting references to lexical variables outside their
own scopes.  These lexicals magically refer to the variables that were
around when the subroutine was defined (deep binding).
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Closures make sense in any programming language where you can have the
return value of a function be itself a function, as you can in Perl.
Note that some languages provide anonymous functions but are not
capable of providing proper closures: the Python language, for
example.  For more information on closures, check out any textbook on
functional programming.  Scheme is a language that not only supports
but encourages closures.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Here's a classic function-generating function:

    sub add_function_generator {
      return sub { shift + shift };
    }

    $add_sub = add_function_generator();
    $sum = $add_sub-&gt;(4,5);                # $sum is 9 now.
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The closure works as a <i>function template</i> with some customization
slots left out to be filled later.  The anonymous subroutine returned
by add_function_generator() isn't technically a closure because it
refers to no lexicals outside its own scope.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Contrast this with the following make_adder() function, in which the
returned anonymous function contains a reference to a lexical variable
outside the scope of that function itself.  Such a reference requires
that Perl return a proper closure, thus locking in for all time the
value that the lexical had when the function was created.

    sub make_adder {
        my $addpiece = shift;
        return sub { shift + $addpiece };
    }

    $f1 = make_adder(20);
    $f2 = make_adder(555);
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Now <code>&amp;$f1($n)</code> is always 20 plus whatever $n you pass in, whereas
<code>&amp;$f2($n)</code> is always 555 plus whatever $n you pass in.  The $addpiece
in the closure sticks around.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Closures are often used for less esoteric purposes.  For example, when
you want to pass in a bit of code into a function:

    my $line;
    timeout( 30, sub { $line = &lt;STDIN&gt; } );
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If the code to execute had been passed in as a string,
<code>'$line = &lt;STDIN&gt;'</code>, there would have been no way for the
hypothetical timeout() function to access the lexical variable
$line back in its caller's scope.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="What_is_variable_sui">What is variable suicide and how can I prevent it?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Variable suicide is when you (temporarily or permanently) lose the
value of a variable.  It is caused by scoping through my() and local()
interacting with either closures or aliased foreach() iterator
variables and subroutine arguments.  It used to be easy to
inadvertently lose a variable's value this way, but now it's much
harder.  Take this code:

    my $f = &quot;foo&quot;;
    sub T {
      while ($i++ &lt; 3) { my $f = $f; $f .= &quot;bar&quot;; print $f, &quot;\n&quot; }
    }
    T;
    print &quot;Finally $f\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The $f that has &quot;bar&quot; added to it three times should be a new <code>$f</code>
(<code>my $f</code> should create a new local variable each time through the loop).
It isn't, however.  This was a bug, now fixed in the latest releases
(tested against 5.004_05, 5.005_03, and 5.005_56).
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_can_I_pass_retur">How can I pass/return a {Function, FileHandle, Array, Hash, Method, Regex}?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
With the exception of regexes, you need to pass references to these
objects.  See the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html#Pass_by_Reference">Pass by Reference</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a> manpage for this particular
question, and the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlref.html">perlref</a> manpage for information on references.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
See ``Passing Regexes'', below, for information on passing regular
expressions.
</p>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Passing_Variables_an">Passing Variables and Functions</a>
<dd>
Regular variables and functions are quite easy to pass: just pass in a
reference to an existing or anonymous variable or function:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    func( \$some_scalar );

    func( \@some_array  );
    func( [ 1 .. 10 ]   );

    func( \%some_hash   );
    func( { this =&gt; 10, that =&gt; 20 }   );

    func( \&amp;some_func   );
    func( sub { $_[0] ** $_[1] }   );
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Passing_Filehandles">Passing Filehandles</a>
<dd>
To pass filehandles to subroutines, use the <code>*FH</code> or <code>\*FH</code> notations.
These are &quot;typeglobs&quot;--see the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perldata.html#Typeglobs_and_Fileha">Typeglobs and Filehandles</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perldata.html">perldata</a> manpage
and especially the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html#Pass_by_Reference">Pass by Reference</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a> manpage for more information.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Here's an excerpt:
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you're passing around filehandles, you could usually just use the bare
typeglob, like *STDOUT, but typeglobs references would be better because
they'll still work properly under <code>use strict 'refs'</code>.  For example:

    splutter(\*STDOUT);
    sub splutter {
        my $fh = shift;
        print $fh &quot;her um well a hmmm\n&quot;;
    }

    $rec = get_rec(\*STDIN);
    sub get_rec {
        my $fh = shift;
        return scalar &lt;$fh&gt;;
    }
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you're planning on generating new filehandles, you could do this:

    sub openit {
        my $path = shift;
        local *FH;
        return open (FH, $path) ? *FH : undef;
    }
    $fh = openit('&lt; /etc/motd');
    print &lt;$fh&gt;;
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Passing_Regexes">Passing Regexes</a>
<dd>
To pass regexes around, you'll need to be using a release of Perl
sufficiently recent as to support the <code>qr//</code> construct, pass around
strings and use an exception-trapping eval, or else be very, very clever.
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Here's an example of how to pass in a string to be regex compared
using <code>qr//</code>:

    sub compare($$) {
        my ($val1, $regex) = @_;
        my $retval = $val1 =~ /$regex/;
	return $retval;
    }
    $match = compare(&quot;old McDonald&quot;, qr/d.*D/i);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Notice how <code>qr//</code> allows flags at the end.  That pattern was compiled
at compile time, although it was executed later.  The nifty <code>qr//</code>
notation wasn't introduced until the 5.005 release.  Before that, you
had to approach this problem much less intuitively.  For example, here
it is again if you don't have <code>qr//</code>:

    sub compare($$) {
        my ($val1, $regex) = @_;
        my $retval = eval { $val1 =~ /$regex/ };
	die if $@;
	return $retval;
    }

    $match = compare(&quot;old McDonald&quot;, q/($?i)d.*D/);

<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Make sure you never say something like this:

    return eval &quot;\$val =~ /$regex/&quot;;   # WRONG
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
or someone can sneak shell escapes into the regex due to the double
interpolation of the eval and the double-quoted string.  For example:

    $pattern_of_evil = 'danger ${ system(&quot;rm -rf * &amp;&quot;) } danger';

    eval &quot;\$string =~ /$pattern_of_evil/&quot;;

To pass an object method into a subroutine, you can do this:

    call_a_lot(10, $some_obj, &quot;methname&quot;)
    sub call_a_lot {
        my ($count, $widget, $trick) = @_;

            $widget-&gt;$trick();
        }
    }
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Or, you can use a closure to bundle up the object, its
method call, and arguments:

    my $whatnot =  sub { $some_obj-&gt;obfuscate(@args) };

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_create_a_st">How do I create a static variable?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
As with most things in Perl, TMTOWTDI.  What is a &quot;static variable&quot; in
other languages could be either a function-private variable (visible
only within a single function, retaining its value between calls to
that function), or a file-private variable (visible only to functions
within the file it was declared in) in Perl.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Here's code to implement a function-private variable:

    BEGIN {
        my $counter = 42;
        sub prev_counter { return --$counter }
        sub next_counter { return $counter++ }
    }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Now prev_counter() and next_counter() share a private variable $counter
that was initialized at compile time.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
To declare a file-private variable, you'll still use a my(), putting
the declaration at the outer scope level at the top of the file.
Assume this is in file Pax.pm:

    package Pax;
    my $started = scalar(localtime(time()));

    sub begun { return $started }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
When <code>use Pax</code> or <code>require Pax</code> loads this module, the variable will
be initialized.  It won't get garbage-collected the way most variables
going out of scope do, because the begun() function cares about it,
but no one else can get it.  It is not called $Pax::started because
its scope is unrelated to the package.  It's scoped to the file.  You
could conceivably have several packages in that same file all
accessing the same private variable, but another file with the same
package couldn't get to it.

<p class="POD_TEXT">
<code>local($x)</code> saves away the old value of the global variable <code>$x</code>
and assigns a new value for the duration of the subroutine <i>which is
visible in other functions called from that subroutine</i>.  This is done
at run-time, so is called dynamic scoping.  local() always affects global
variables, also called package variables or dynamic variables.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
<code>my($x)</code> creates a new variable that is only visible in the current
subroutine.  This is done at compile-time, so it is called lexical or
static scoping.  my() always affects private variables, also called
lexical variables or (improperly) static(ly scoped) variables.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
For instance:

    sub visible {
	print &quot;var has value $var\n&quot;;
    }

    sub dynamic {
	local $var = 'local';	# new temporary value for the still-global
	visible();              #   variable called $var

    sub lexical {
	my $var = 'private';    # new private variable, $var

    $var = 'global';

    visible();      		# prints global
    dynamic();      		# prints local
    lexical();      		# prints global
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Notice how at no point does the value &quot;private&quot; get printed.  That's
because $var only has that value within the block of the lexical()
function, and it is hidden from called subroutine.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In summary, local() doesn't make what you think of as private, local
variables.  It gives a global variable a temporary value.  my() is
what you're looking for if you want private variables.

You can do this via symbolic references, provided you haven't set

If you know your package, you can just mention it explicitly, as in
$Some_Pack::var.  Note that the notation $::var is <i>not</i> the dynamic
$var in the current package, but rather the one in the <code>main</code>
package, as though you had written $main::var.  Specifying the package
directly makes you hard-code its name, but it executes faster and
avoids running afoul of <code>use strict &quot;refs&quot;</code>.

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="What_s_the_differenc1">What's the difference between deep and shallow binding?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In deep binding, lexical variables mentioned in anonymous subroutines
are the same ones that were in scope when the subroutine was created.
In shallow binding, they are whichever variables with the same names
happen to be in scope when the subroutine is called.  Perl always uses
deep binding of lexical variables (i.e., those created with my()).
However, dynamic variables (aka global, local, or package variables)
are effectively shallowly bound.  Consider this just one more reason
not to use them.  See the answer to the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="#What_s_a_closure_">What's a closure?</a> elsewhere in this document.

<code>my()</code> and <code>local()</code> give list context to the right hand side
of <code>=</code>.  The &lt;FH&gt; read operation, like so many of Perl's
functions and operators, can tell which context it was called in and
behaves appropriately.  In general, the scalar() function can help.
This function does nothing to the data itself (contrary to popular myth)
but rather tells its argument to behave in whatever its scalar fashion is.
If that function doesn't have a defined scalar behavior, this of course
doesn't help you (such as with sort()).
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
To enforce scalar context in this particular case, however, you need
merely omit the parentheses:

different characters or if you want to arrange the matches so that

Beginners often think they want to have a variable contain the name

</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This works <i>sometimes</i>, but it is a very bad idea for two reasons.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The first reason is that this technique <i>only works on global
variables</i>.  That means that if $fred is a lexical variable created
with my() in the above example, the code wouldn't work at all: you'd
accidentally access the global and skip right over the private lexical
altogether.  Global variables are bad because they can easily collide
accidentally and in general make for non-scalable and confusing code.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Symbolic references are forbidden under the <code>use strict</code> pragma.
They are not true references and consequently are not reference counted
or garbage collected.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The other reason why using a variable to hold the name of another
variable is a bad idea is that the question often stems from a lack of
understanding of Perl data structures, particularly hashes.  By using
symbolic references, you are just using the package's symbol-table hash
(like <code>%main::</code>) instead of a user-defined hash.  The solution is to
use your own hash or a real reference instead.

    $fred    = 23;
    $varname = &quot;fred&quot;;
    $USER_VARS{$varname}++;  # not $$varname++
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
There we're using the %USER_VARS hash instead of symbolic references.
Sometimes this comes up in reading strings from the user with variable
references and wanting to expand them to the values of your perl
program's variables.  This is also a bad idea because it conflates the
program-addressable namespace and the user-addressable one.  Instead of
reading a string and expanding it to the actual contents of your program's
own variables:

    $str = 'this has a $fred and $barney in it';
    $str =~ s/(\$\w+)/$1/eeg;		  # need double eval
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
it would be better to keep a hash around like %USER_VARS and have
variable references actually refer to entries in that hash:

    $str =~ s/\$(\w+)/$USER_VARS{$1}/g;   # no /e here at all
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
That's faster, cleaner, and safer than the previous approach.  Of course,
you don't need to use a dollar sign.  You could use your own scheme to
make it less confusing, like bracketed percent symbols, etc.

    $str = 'this has a %fred% and %barney% in it';
    $str =~ s/%(\w+)%/$USER_VARS{$1}/g;   # no /e here at all
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Another reason that folks sometimes think they want a variable to
contain the name of a variable is because they don't know how to build
proper data structures using hashes.  For example, let's say they
wanted two hashes in their program: %fred and %barney, and that they
wanted to use another scalar variable to refer to those by name.

    $name = &quot;fred&quot;;
    $$name{WIFE} = &quot;wilma&quot;;     # set %fred

    $name = &quot;barney&quot;;           
    $$name{WIFE} = &quot;betty&quot;;	# set %barney
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This is still a symbolic reference, and is still saddled with the
problems enumerated above.  It would be far better to write:

    $folks{&quot;fred&quot;}{WIFE}   = &quot;wilma&quot;;
    $folks{&quot;barney&quot;}{WIFE} = &quot;betty&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
And just use a multilevel hash to start with.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The only times that you absolutely <i>must</i> use symbolic references are
when you really must refer to the symbol table.  This may be because it's
something that can't take a real reference to, such as a format name.
Doing so may also be important for method calls, since these always go
through the symbol table for resolution.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In those cases, you would turn off <code>strict 'refs'</code> temporarily so you
can play around with the symbol table.  For example:

    @colors = qw(red blue green yellow orange purple violet);
    for my $name (@colors) {
        no strict 'refs';  # renege for the block
        *$name = sub { &quot;&lt;FONT COLOR='$name'&gt;@_&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; };

So, sometimes you might want to use symbolic references to directly
manipulate the symbol table.  This doesn't matter for formats, handles, and
subroutines, because they are always global--you can't use my() on them.
For scalars, arrays, and hashes, though--and usually for subroutines--
you probably only want to use hard references.
