    <h1>Core Perl Documentation (v5.6.1)</h1>

    <P>Every Every perl distribution comes with the following
    documentation, typically viewable through the standard man(1)
    program, the slower and less flexible perldoc(1) program, or as
    HTML. However, many programmers seem to have trouble finding that
    documentation, so here it all is; you may also fetch it manually
    as one gigantic GNU-zipped tarfile (1593k) for viewing on your
    local system.
