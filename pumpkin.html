Pumpkin - Notes on handling the Perl Patch Pumpkin
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
There is no simple synopsis, yet.
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This document attempts to begin to describe some of the considerations
involved in patching, porting, and maintaining perl.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This document is still under construction, and still subject to
significant changes.  Still, I hope parts of it will be useful,
so I'm releasing it even though it's not done.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
For the most part, it's a collection of anecdotal information that
already assumes some familiarity with the Perl sources.  I really need
an introductory section that describes the organization of the sources
and all the various auxiliary files that are part of the distribution.
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="Where_Do_I_Get_Perl_">Where Do I Get Perl Sources and Related Material?</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (or CPAN) is the place to go.
There are many mirrors, but the easiest thing to use is probably
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/README.html , which automatically points you to a
mirror site &quot;close&quot; to you.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Perl5_porters_mailin">Perl5-porters mailing list</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The mailing list perl5-porters@perl.org
is the main group working with the development of perl.  If you're
interested in all the latest developments, you should definitely
subscribe.  The list is high volume, but generally has a
fairly low noise level.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Subscribe by sending the message (in the body of your letter)

	subscribe perl5-porters
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
to perl5-porters-request@perl.org .
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Archives of the list are held at:

    http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl-porters/
</pre>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="How_are_Perl_Release">How are Perl Releases Numbered?</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Beginning with v5.6.0, even versions will stand for maintenance releases
and odd versions for development releases, i.e., v5.6.x for maintenance
releases, and v5.7.x for development releases.  Before v5.6.0, subversions
_01 through _49 were reserved for bug-fix maintenance releases, and
subversions _50 through _99 for unstable development versions.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
For example, in v5.6.1, the revision number is 5, the version is 6,
and 1 is the subversion.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
For compatibility with the older numbering scheme the composite floating
point version number continues to be available as the magic variable $],
and amounts to <code>$revision + $version/1000 + $subversion/100000</code>.  This
can still be used in comparisons.

	print &quot;You've got an old perl\n&quot; if $] &lt; 5.005_03;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In addition, the version is also available as a string in $^V.

	print &quot;You've got a new perl\n&quot; if $^V and $^V ge v5.6.0;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
You can also require particular version (or later) with:

        use 5.006;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
or using the new syntax available only from v5.6 onward:

	use v5.6.0;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
At some point in the future, we may need to decide what to call the
next big revision.  In the .package file used by metaconfig to
generate Configure, there are two variables that might be relevant:
$baserev=5 and $package=perl5.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Perl releases produced by the members of perl5-porters are usually
available on CPAN in the <code>src/5.0/maint</code> and <code>src/5.0/devel</code>
directories.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Maintenance_and_Deve">Maintenance and Development Subversions</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The first rule of maintenance work is &quot;First, do no harm.&quot;
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Trial releases of bug-fix maintenance releases are announced on
perl5-porters. Trial releases use the new subversion number (to avoid
testers installing it over the previous release) and include a 'local
patch' entry in patchlevel.h. The distribution file contains the
string <code>MAINT_TRIAL</code> to make clear that the file is not meant for
public consumption.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In general, the names of official distribution files for the public
always match the regular expression:

    ^perl\d+\.(\d+)\.\d+(-MAINT_TRIAL_\d+)\.tar\.gz$
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
<code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_1_is_the_same_as_su">$1</a></code> in the pattern is always an even number for maintenance
versions, and odd for developer releases.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In the past it has been observed that pumkings tend to invent new
naming conventions on the fly. If you are a pumpking, before you
invent a new name for any of the three types of perl distributions,
please inform the guys from the CPAN who are doing indexing and
provide the trees of symlinks and the like. They will have to know
<i>in advance</i> what you decide.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Why_is_it_called_the">Why is it called the patch pumpkin?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Chip Salzenberg gets credit for that, with a nod to his cow orker,
David Croy.  We had passed around various names (baton, token, hot
potato) but none caught on.  Then, Chip asked:
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
[begin quote]

   Who has the patch pumpkin?
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
To explain:  David Croy once told me once that at a previous job,
there was one tape drive and multiple systems that used it for backups.
But instead of some high-tech exclusion software, they used a low-tech
method to prevent multiple simultaneous backups: a stuffed pumpkin.
No one was allowed to make backups unless they had the &quot;backup pumpkin&quot;.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
[end quote]
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The name has stuck.
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="Philosophical_Issues">Philosophical Issues in Patching and Porting Perl</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
There are no absolute rules, but there are some general guidelines I
have tried to follow as I apply patches to the perl sources.
(This section is still under construction.)
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Solve_problems_as_ge">Solve problems as generally as possible</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Never implement a specific restricted solution to a problem when you
can solve the same problem in a more general, flexible way.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
For example, for dynamic loading to work on some SVR4 systems, we had
to build a shared libperl.so library.  In order to build &quot;FAT&quot; binaries
on NeXT 4.0 systems, we had to build a special libperl library.  Rather
than continuing to build a contorted nest of special cases, I
generalized the process of building libperl so that NeXT and SVR4 users
could still get their work done, but others could build a shared
libperl if they wanted to as well.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Contain your changes carefully.  Assume nothing about other operating
systems, not even closely related ones.  Your changes must not affect
other platforms.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Spy shamelessly on how similar patching or porting issues have been
settled elsewhere.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If feasible, try to keep filenames 8.3-compliant to humor those poor
souls that get joy from running Perl under such dire limitations.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Seek_consensus_on_ma">Seek consensus on major changes</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you are making big changes, don't do it in secret.  Discuss the
ideas in advance on perl5-porters.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Keep_the_documentati">Keep the documentation up-to-date</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If your changes may affect how users use perl, then check to be sure
that the documentation is in sync with your changes.  Be sure to
check all the files <code>pod/*.pod</code> and also the <code>INSTALL</code> document.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Consider writing the appropriate documentation first and then
implementing your change to correspond to the documentation.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Avoid_machine_specif">Avoid machine-specific #ifdef's</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
To the extent reasonable, try to avoid machine-specific #ifdef's in
the sources.  Instead, use feature-specific #ifdef's.  The reason is
that the machine-specific #ifdef's may not be valid across major
releases of the operating system.  Further, the feature-specific tests
may help out folks on another platform who have the same problem.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Machine_specific_fil">Machine-specific files</a></h3>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="source_code">source code</a>
<dd>
If you have many machine-specific #defines or #includes, consider
creating an &quot;osish.h&quot; (os2ish.h, vmsish.h, and so on) and including
that in perl.h.  If you have several machine-specific files (function
emulations, function stubs, build utility wrappers) you may create a
separate subdirectory (djgpp, win32) and put the files in there.
Remember to update <code>MANIFEST</code> when you add files.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If your system supports dynamic loading but none of the existing
methods at <code>ext/DynaLoader/dl_*.xs</code> work for you, you must write
a new one.  Study the existing ones to see what kind of interface
you must supply.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="build_hints">build hints</a>
<dd>
There are two kinds of hints: hints for building Perl and hints for
extensions.   The former live in the <code>hints</code> subdirectory, the latter
in <code>ext/*/hints</code> subdirectories.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The top level hints are Bourne-shell scripts that set, modify and
unset appropriate Configure variables, based on the Configure command
line options and possibly existing config.sh and Policy.sh files from
previous Configure runs.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The extension hints are written in Perl (by the time they are used
miniperl has been built) and control the building of their respective
extensions.  They can be used to for example manipulate compilation
and linking flags.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="build_and_installati">build and installation Makefiles, scripts, and so forth</a>
<dd>
Sometimes you will also need to tweak the Perl build and installation
procedure itself, like for example <code>Makefile.SH</code> and <code>installperl</code>.
Tread very carefully, even more than usual.  Contain your changes
with utmost care.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="test_suite">test suite</a>
<dd>
Many of the tests in <code>t</code> subdirectory assume machine-specific things
like existence of certain functions, something about filesystem
semantics, certain external utilities and their error messages.  Use
the <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_O">$^O</a></code> and the <code>Config</code> module (which contains the results of the
Configure run, in effect the <code>config.sh</code> converted to Perl) to either
skip (preferably not) or customize (preferable) the tests for your
platform.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="modules">modules</a>
<dd>
Certain standard modules may need updating if your operating system
sports for example a native filesystem naming.  You may want to update
some or all of the modules File::Basename, File::Spec, File::Path, and
File::Copy to become aware of your native filesystem syntax and
peculiarities.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="documentation">documentation</a>
<dd>
If your operating system comes from outside UNIX you almost certainly
will have differences in the available operating system functionality
(missing system calls, different semantics, whatever).  Please
document these at <code>pod/perlport.pod</code>.  If your operating system is
the first <b>not</b> to have a system call also update the list of
&quot;portability-bewares&quot; at the beginning of <code>pod/perlfunc.pod</code>.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
A file called <code>README.youros</code> at the top level that explains things
like how to install perl at this platform, where to get any possibly
required additional software, and for example what test suite errors
to expect, is nice too.  Such files are in the process of being written
in pod format and will eventually be renamed <code>INSTALL.youros</code>.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
You may also want to write a separate <code>.pod</code> file for your operating
system to tell about existing mailing lists, os-specific modules,
documentation, whatever.  Please name these along the lines of
<code>perl</code><i>youros</i>.pod.  [unfinished: where to put this file (the pod/
subdirectory, of course: but more importantly, which/what index files
should be updated?)]
</p>
</dl>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Allow_for_lots_of_te">Allow for lots of testing</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
We should never release a main version without testing it as a
subversion first.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Test_popular_applica">Test popular applications and modules.</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
We should never release a main version without testing whether or not
it breaks various popular modules and applications.  A partial list of
such things would include majordomo, metaconfig, apache, Tk, CGI,
libnet, and libwww, to name just a few.  Of course it's quite possible
that some of those things will be just plain broken and need to be fixed,
but, in general, we ought to try to avoid breaking widely-installed
things.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Automated_generation">Automated generation of derivative files</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The <code>embed.h</code>, <code>keywords.h</code>, <code>opcode.h</code>, and <code>perltoc.pod</code> files
are all automatically generated by perl scripts.  In general, don't
patch these directly; patch the data files instead.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
<code>Configure</code> and <code>config_h.SH</code> are also automatically generated by
<b>metaconfig</b>.  In general, you should patch the metaconfig units
instead of patching these files directly.  However, very minor changes
to <code>Configure</code> may be made in between major sync-ups with the
metaconfig units, which tends to be complicated operations.  But be
careful, this can quickly spiral out of control.  Running metaconfig
is not really hard.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Also <code>Makefile</code> is automatically produced from <code>Makefile.SH</code>.
In general, look out for all <code>*.SH</code> files.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Finally, the sample files in the <code>Porting/</code> subdirectory are
generated automatically by the script <code>U/mksample</code> included 
with the metaconfig units.  See the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="#run_metaconfig">run metaconfig</a> elsewhere in this document below for
information on obtaining the metaconfig units.
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="How_to_Make_a_Distri">How to Make a Distribution</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
There really ought to be a 'make dist' target, but there isn't.
The 'dist' suite of tools also contains a number of tools that I haven't
learned how to use yet.  Some of them may make this all a bit easier.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Here are the steps I go through to prepare a patch &amp; distribution.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Lots of it could doubtless be automated but isn't.  The Porting/makerel
(make release) perl script does now help automate some parts of it.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Announce_your_intent">Announce your intentions</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
First, you should volunteer out loud to take the patch pumpkin.  It's
generally counter-productive to have multiple people working in secret
on the same thing.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
At the same time, announce what you plan to do with the patch pumpkin,
to allow folks a chance to object or suggest alternatives, or do it for
you.  Naturally, the patch pumpkin holder ought to incorporate various
bug fixes and documentation improvements that are posted while he or
she has the pumpkin, but there might also be larger issues at stake.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
One of the precepts of the subversion idea is that we shouldn't give
the patch pumpkin to anyone unless we have some idea what he or she
is going to do with it.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="refresh_pod_perltoc_">refresh pod/perltoc.pod</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Presumably, you have done a full <code>make</code> in your working source
directory.  Before you <code>make spotless</code> (if you do), and if you have
changed any documentation in any module or pod file, change to the
<code>pod</code> directory and run <code>make toc</code>.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="run_installhtml_to_c">run installhtml to check the validity of the pod files</a></h3>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="update_patchlevel_h">update patchlevel.h</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Don't be shy about using the subversion number, even for a relatively
modest patch.  We've never even come close to using all 99 subversions,
and it's better to have a distinctive number for your patch.  If you
need feedback on your patch, go ahead and issue it and promise to
incorporate that feedback quickly (e.g. within 1 week) and send out a
second patch.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="run_metaconfig">run metaconfig</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you need to make changes to Configure or config_h.SH, it may be best to
change the appropriate metaconfig units instead, and regenerate Configure.

	metaconfig -m
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
will regenerate Configure and config_h.SH.  Much more information
on obtaining and running metaconfig is in the <code>U/README</code> file
that comes with Perl's metaconfig units.  Perl's metaconfig units
should be available on CPAN.  A set of units that will work with
perl5.005 is in the file <code>mc_units-5.005_00-01.tar.gz</code> under
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/ANDYD/ .  The mc_units tar file
should be unpacked in your main perl source directory.  Note: those
units were for use with 5.005.  There may have been changes since then.
Check for later versions or contact perl5-porters@perl.org to obtain a
pointer to the current version.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Alternatively, do consider if the <code>*ish.h</code> files might be a better
place for your changes.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="MANIFEST">MANIFEST</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Make sure the MANIFEST is up-to-date.  You can use dist's <b>manicheck</b>
program for this.  You can also use

    perl -w -MExtUtils::Manifest=fullcheck -e fullcheck
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Both commands will also list extra files in the directory that are not
listed in MANIFEST.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The MANIFEST is normally sorted.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you are using metaconfig to regenerate Configure, then you should note
that metaconfig actually uses MANIFEST.new, so you want to be sure
MANIFEST.new is up-to-date too.  I haven't found the MANIFEST/MANIFEST.new
distinction particularly useful, but that's probably because I still haven't
learned how to use the full suite of tools in the dist distribution.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Check_permissions">Check permissions</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
All the tests in the t/ directory ought to be executable.  The
main makefile used to do a 'chmod t/*/*.t', but that resulted in
a self-modifying distribution--something some users would strongly
prefer to avoid.  The <code>t/TEST</code> script will check for this
and do the chmod if needed, but the tests still ought to be
executable.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In all, the following files should probably be executable:

    Configure
    configpm
    configure.gnu
    embed.pl
    installperl
    installman
    keywords.pl
    myconfig
    opcode.pl
    perly.fixer
    t/TEST
    t/*/*.t
    *.SH
    vms/ext/Stdio/test.pl
    vms/ext/filespec.t
    x2p/*.SH
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Other things ought to be readable, at least :-).
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Probably, the permissions for the files could be encoded in MANIFEST
somehow, but I'm reluctant to change MANIFEST itself because that
could break old scripts that use MANIFEST.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
I seem to recall that some SVR3 systems kept some sort of file that listed
permissions for system files; something like that might be appropriate.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Run_Configure">Run Configure</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This will build a config.sh and config.h.  You can skip this if you haven't
changed Configure or config_h.SH at all.  I use the following command

    sh Configure -Dprefix=/opt/perl -Doptimize=-O -Dusethreads \
	-Dcf_by='yourname' \
	-Dcf_email='yourname@yourhost.yourplace.com' \

the task of keeping the vms, win32, and plan9 config.sh info
up-to-date.  The plan is to use keep up-to-date 'canned' config.sh
files in the appropriate subdirectories and then generate 'canned'
config.h files for vms, win32, etc. from the generic config.sh file.
This is to ease maintenance.  When Configure gets updated, the parts
sometimes get scrambled around, and the changes in config_H can
sometimes be very hard to follow.  config.sh, on the other hand, can
safely be sorted, so it's easy to track (typically very small) changes
to config.sh and then propoagate them to a canned 'config.h' by any
number of means, including a perl script in win32/ or carrying 
config.sh and config_h.SH to a Unix system and running sh
config_h.SH.)  Vms uses configure.com to generate its own config.sh
and config.h.  If you want to add a new variable to config.sh check
with vms folk how to add it to configure.com too.

</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The Porting/config.sh and Porting/config_H files are provided to
help those folks who can't run Configure.  It is important to keep
them up-to-date.  If you have changed config_h.SH, those changes must
be reflected in config_H as well.  (The name config_H was chosen to
distinguish the file from config.h even on case-insensitive file systems.)
Simply edit the existing config_H file; keep the first few explanatory
lines and then copy your new config.h below.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
It may also be necessary to update win32/config.?c, and
plan9/config.plan9, though you should be quite careful in doing so if
you are not familiar with those systems.  You might want to issue your
patch with a promise to quickly issue a follow-up that handles those
directories.

If you have byacc-1.8.2 (available from CPAN), and if there have been
changes to <code>perly.y</code>, you can regenerate the <code>perly.c</code> file.  The
run_byacc makefile target does this by running byacc and then applying
some patches so that byacc dynamically allocates space, rather than
having fixed limits.  This patch is handled by the <code>perly.fixer</code>
script.  Depending on the nature of the changes to <code>perly.y</code>, you may
or may not have to hand-edit the patch to apply correctly.  If you do,
you should include the edited patch in the new distribution.  If you
have byacc-1.9, the patch won't apply cleanly.  Changes to the printf
output statements mean the patch won't apply cleanly.  Long ago I
started to fix <code>perly.fixer</code> to detect this, but I never completed the
task.

If <code>perly.c</code> or <code>perly.h</code> changes, make sure you run <code>perl vms/vms_yfix.pl</code>

Here's how I generate a new patch.  I'll use the hypothetical
5.004_07 to 5.004_08 patch as an example.

	# unpack perl5.004_07/
	gzip -d -c perl5.004_07.tar.gz | tar -xof -
	# unpack perl5.004_08/

<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Makepatch will automatically generate appropriate <b>rm</b> commands to remove
deleted files.  Unfortunately, it will not correctly set permissions
for newly created files, so you may have to do so manually.  For example,
patch 5.003_04 created a new test <code>t/op/gv.t</code> which needs to be executable,
so at the top of the patch, I inserted the following lines:

	# Make a new test
	touch t/op/gv.t
	chmod +x t/opt/gv.t

<p class="POD_TEXT">
Now, of course, my patch is now wrong because makepatch didn't know I
was going to do that command, and it patched against /dev/null.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
So, what I do is sort out all such shell commands that need to be in the
patch (including possible mv-ing of files, if needed) and put that in the
shell commands at the top of the patch.  Next, I delete all the patch parts
of perl5.004_08.pat, leaving just the shell commands.  Then, I do the
following:

	cd perl5.004_07
	sh ../perl5.004_08.pat

Purify is a commercial tool that is helpful in identifying memory

Use the following commands to test perl with Purify:

	sh Configure -des -Doptimize=-g -Uusemymalloc -Dusemultiplicity \

Disabling Perl's malloc allows Purify to monitor allocations and leaks
more closely; using Perl's malloc will make Purify report most leaks
in the &quot;potential&quot; leaks category.  Enabling the multiplicity option
allows perl to clean up thoroughly when the interpreter shuts down, which
reduces the number of bogus leak reports from Purify.  The -DPURIFY
enables any Purify-specific debugging code in the sources.

Purify outputs messages in &quot;Viewer&quot; windows by default.  If you don't have

It's often the case that you'll need to choose whether to do
something the BSD-ish way or the POSIX-ish way.  It's usually not
a big problem when the two systems use different names for similar
functions, such as memcmp() and bcmp().  The perl.h header file
handles these by appropriate #defines, selecting the POSIX mem*()
functions if available, but falling back on the b*() functions, if
need be.
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
More serious is the case where some brilliant person decided to
use the same function name but give it a different meaning or
calling sequence :-).  getpgrp() and setpgrp() come to mind.
These are a real problem on systems that aim for conformance to
one standard (e.g. POSIX), but still try to support the other way
of doing things (e.g. BSD).  My general advice (still not really
implemented in the source) is to do something like the following.
Suppose there are two alternative versions, fooPOSIX() and
fooBSD().

    #ifdef HAS_FOOPOSIX
	/* use fooPOSIX(); */
    #else
    #  ifdef HAS_FOOBSD
	/* try to emulate fooPOSIX() with fooBSD();
	   perhaps with the following:  */
    #    define fooPOSIX fooBSD

Not all systems have all the neat functions you might want or need, so
you might decide to be helpful and provide an emulation.  This is
sound in theory and very kind of you, but please be careful about what
you name the function.  Let me use the <code>pause()</code> function as an
illustration.
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Perl5.003 has the following in <code>perl.h</code>

    #ifndef HAS_PAUSE
    #define pause() sleep((32767&lt;&lt;16)+32767)
    #endif
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Configure sets HAS_PAUSE if the system has the pause() function, so
this #define only kicks in if the pause() function is missing.
Nice idea, right?
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Unfortunately, some systems apparently have a prototype for pause()
in <code>unistd.h</code>, but don't actually have the function in the library.
(Or maybe they do have it in a library we're not using.)
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Thus, the compiler sees something like

    extern int pause(void);
    /* . . . */
    #define pause() sleep((32767&lt;&lt;16)+32767)
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
and dies with an error message.  (Some compilers don't mind this;
others apparently do.)
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
To work around this, 5.003_03 and later have the following in perl.h:

    /* Some unistd.h's give a prototype for pause() even though
       HAS_PAUSE ends up undefined.  This causes the #define
       below to be rejected by the compiler.  Sigh.
    */
    #ifdef HAS_PAUSE
    #  define Pause	pause
    #else
    #  define Pause() sleep((32767&lt;&lt;16)+32767)
    #endif
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This works.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The curious reader may wonder why I didn't do the following in
<code>util.c</code> instead:

    #ifndef HAS_PAUSE
    void pause()
    {
    sleep((32767&lt;&lt;16)+32767);
    }
    #endif
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
That is, since the function is missing, just provide it.
Then things would probably be been alright, it would seem.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Well, almost.  It could be made to work.  The problem arises from the
conflicting needs of dynamic loading and namespace protection.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
For dynamic loading to work on AIX (and VMS) we need to provide a list
of symbols to be exported.  This is done by the script <code>perl_exp.SH</code>,
which reads <code>global.sym</code> and <code>interp.sym</code>.  Thus, the <code>pause</code>
symbol would have to be added to <code>global.sym</code>  So far, so good.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
On the other hand, one of the goals of Perl5 is to make it easy to
either extend or embed perl and link it with other libraries.  This
means we have to be careful to keep the visible namespace &quot;clean&quot;.
That is, we don't want perl's global variables to conflict with
those in the other application library.  Although this work is still
in progress, the way it is currently done is via the <code>embed.h</code> file.
This file is built from the <code>global.sym</code> and <code>interp.sym</code> files,
since those files already list the globally visible symbols.  If we
had added <code>pause</code> to global.sym, then <code>embed.h</code> would contain the
line

    #define pause	Perl_pause
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
and calls to <code>pause</code> in the perl sources would now point to
<code>Perl_pause</code>.  Now, when <b>ld</b> is run to build the <code>perl</code> executable,
it will go looking for <code>perl_pause</code>, which probably won't exist in any
of the standard libraries.  Thus the build of perl will fail.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Those systems where <code>HAS_PAUSE</code> is not defined would be ok, however,
since they would get a <code>Perl_pause</code> function in util.c.  The rest of
the world would be in trouble.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
And yes, this scenario has happened.  On SCO, the function <code>chsize</code>
is available.  (I think it's in <code>-lx</code>, the Xenix compatibility
library.)  Since the perl4 days (and possibly before), Perl has
included a <code>chsize</code> function that gets called something akin to

    #ifndef HAS_CHSIZE
    I32 chsize(fd, length)

</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">

     just plain chsize if this system HAS_CHSIZE.  This probably only
     applies to SCO.  This shows the perils of having internal
     functions with the same name as external library functions :-).
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Now, we can safely put <code>my_chsize</code> in <code>global.sym</code>, export it, and
hide it with <code>embed.h</code>.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
To be consistent with what I did for <code>pause</code>, I probably should have
called the new function <code>Chsize</code>, rather than <code>my_chsize</code>.
However, the perl sources are quite inconsistent on this (Consider
New, Mymalloc, and Myremalloc, to name just a few.)
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
There is a problem with this fix, however, in that <code>Perl_chsize</code>
was available as a <code>libperl.a</code> library function in 5.003, but it
isn't available any more (as of 5.003_07).  This means that we've
broken binary compatibility.  This is not good.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Providing_missing_fu">Providing missing functions -- some ideas</a>
<dd>
We currently don't have a standard way of handling such missing
function names.  Right now, I'm effectively thinking aloud about a
solution.  Some day, I'll try to formally propose a solution.
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Part of the problem is that we want to have some functions listed as
exported but not have their names mangled by embed.h or possibly
conflict with names in standard system headers.  We actually already
have such a list at the end of <code>perl_exp.SH</code> (though that list is
out-of-date):

    # extra globals not included above.
    cat &lt;&lt;END &gt;&gt; perl.exp
    perl_init_ext
    perl_init_fold
    perl_init_i18nl14n
    perl_alloc
    perl_construct
    perl_destruct
    perl_free
    perl_parse
    perl_run
    perl_get_sv
    perl_get_av
    perl_get_hv
    perl_get_cv
    perl_call_argv
    perl_call_pv
    perl_call_method
    perl_call_sv
    perl_requirepv
    safecalloc
    safemalloc
    saferealloc
    safefree
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This still needs much thought, but I'm inclined to think that one
possible solution is to prefix all such functions with <code>perl_</code> in the
source and list them along with the other <code>perl_*</code> functions in
<code>perl_exp.SH</code>.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Thus, for <code>chsize</code>, we'd do something like the following:

    /* in perl.h */
    #ifdef HAS_CHSIZE
    #  define perl_chsize chsize
    #endif
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
then in some file (e.g. <code>util.c</code> or <code>doio.c</code>) do

    #ifndef HAS_CHSIZE
    I32 perl_chsize(fd, length)
    /* implement the function here . . . */
    #endif
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Alternatively, we could just always use <code>chsize</code> everywhere and move
<code>chsize</code> from <code>global.sym</code> to the end of <code>perl_exp.SH</code>.  That would
probably be fine as long as our <code>chsize</code> function agreed with all the
<code>chsize</code> function prototypes in the various systems we'll be using.
As long as the prototypes in actual use don't vary that much, this is
probably a good alternative.  (As a counter-example, note how Configure
and perl have to go through hoops to find and use get Malloc_t and
Free_t for <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>.)
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
At the moment, this latter option is what I tend to prefer.

Sorry, showing my age:-).  Still, all the world is not BSD 4.[34],
SVR4, or POSIX.  Be aware that SVR3-derived systems are still quite
common (do you have any idea how many systems run SCO?)  If you don't
have a bunch of v7 manuals handy, the metaconfig units (by default
installed in <code>/usr/local/lib/dist/U</code>) are a good resource to look at
for portability.

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Autoconf">Autoconf</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Why does perl use a metaconfig-generated Configure script instead of an
autoconf-generated configure script?
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Metaconfig and autoconf are two tools with very similar purposes.
Metaconfig is actually the older of the two, and was originally written
by Larry Wall, while autoconf is probably now used in a wider variety of
packages.  The autoconf info file discusses the history of autoconf and
how it came to be.  The curious reader is referred there for further
information.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Overall, both tools are quite good, I think, and the choice of which one
to use could be argued either way.  In March, 1994, when I was just
starting to work on Configure support for Perl5, I considered both
autoconf and metaconfig, and eventually decided to use metaconfig for the
following reasons:
</p>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Compatibility_with_P">Compatibility with Perl4</a>
<dd>
Perl4 used metaconfig, so many of the #ifdef's were already set up for
metaconfig.  Of course metaconfig had evolved some since Perl4's days,
but not so much that it posed any serious problems.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Metaconfig_worked_fo">Metaconfig worked for me</a>
<dd>
My system at the time was Interactive 2.2, a SVR3.2/386 derivative that
also had some POSIX support.  Metaconfig-generated Configure scripts
worked fine for me on that system.  On the other hand, autoconf-generated
scripts usually didn't.  (They did come quite close, though, in some
cases.)  At the time, I actually fetched a large number of GNU packages
and checked.  Not a single one configured and compiled correctly
out-of-the-box with the system's cc compiler.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Configure_can_be_int">Configure can be interactive</a>
<dd>
With both autoconf and metaconfig, if the script works, everything is
fine.  However, one of my main problems with autoconf-generated scripts
was that if it guessed wrong about something, it could be <b>very</b> hard to
go back and fix it.  For example, autoconf always insisted on passing the
-Xp flag to cc (to turn on POSIX behavior), even when that wasn't what I
wanted or needed for that package.  There was no way short of editing the
configure script to turn this off.  You couldn't just edit the resulting
Makefile at the end because the -Xp flag influenced a number of other
configure tests.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Metaconfig's Configure scripts, on the other hand, can be interactive.
Thus if Configure is guessing things incorrectly, you can go back and fix
them.  This isn't as important now as it was when we were actively
developing Configure support for new features such as dynamic loading,
but it's still useful occasionally.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="GPL">GPL</a>
<dd>
At the time, autoconf-generated scripts were covered under the GNU Public
License, and hence weren't suitable for inclusion with Perl, which has a
different licensing policy.  (Autoconf's licensing has since changed.)
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Modularity">Modularity</a>
<dd>
Metaconfig builds up Configure from a collection of discrete pieces
called &quot;units&quot;.  You can override the standard behavior by supplying your
own unit.  With autoconf, you have to patch the standard files instead.
I find the metaconfig &quot;unit&quot; method easier to work with.  Others
may find metaconfig's units clumsy to work with.

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Why_isn_t_there_a_di">Why isn't there a directory to override Perl's library?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Mainly because no one's gotten around to making one.  Note that
&quot;making one&quot;  involves changing perl.c, Configure, config_h.SH (and
associated files, see above), and <i>documenting</i> it all in the
INSTALL file.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Apparently, most folks who want to override one of the standard library
files simply do it by overwriting the standard library files.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="APPLLIB">APPLLIB</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In the perl.c sources, you'll find an undocumented APPLLIB_EXP
variable, sort of like PRIVLIB_EXP and ARCHLIB_EXP (which are
documented in config_h.SH).  Here's what APPLLIB_EXP is for, from
a mail message from Larry:

    The main intent of APPLLIB_EXP is for folks who want to send out a
    version of Perl embedded in their product.  They would set the symbol
    to be the name of the library containing the files needed to run or to
    support their particular application.  This works at the &quot;override&quot;
    level to make sure they get their own versions of any library code that
    they absolutely must have configuration control over.

    As such, I don't see any conflict with a sysadmin using it for a
    override-ish sort of thing, when installing a generic Perl.  It should
    probably have been named something to do with overriding though.  Since
    it's undocumented we could still change it...  :-)
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Given that it's already there, you can use it to override
distribution modules.  If you do

	sh Configure -Dccflags='-DAPPLLIB_EXP=/my/override'
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
then perl.c will put /my/override ahead of ARCHLIB and PRIVLIB.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Shared_libperl_so_lo">Shared libperl.so location</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Why isn't the shared libperl.so installed in /usr/lib/ along
with &quot;all the other&quot; shared libraries?  Instead, it is installed
in $archlib, which is typically something like

	/usr/local/lib/perl5/archname/5.00404
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
and is architecture- and version-specific.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The basic reason why a shared libperl.so gets put in $archlib is so that
you can have more than one version of perl on the system at the same time,
and have each refer to its own libperl.so.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Three examples might help.  All of these work now; none would work if you
put libperl.so in /usr/lib.
</p>
<ol class="POD_LIST">
<li class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_"></a>

Suppose you want to have both threaded and non-threaded perl versions
around.  Configure will name both perl libraries &quot;libperl.so&quot; (so that
you can link to them with -lperl).  The perl binaries tell them apart
by having looking in the appropriate $archlib directories.
<li class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_1"></a>

Suppose you have perl5.004_04 installed and you want to try to compile
it again, perhaps with different options or after applying a patch.
If you already have libperl.so installed in /usr/lib/, then it may be
either difficult or impossible to get ld.so to find the new libperl.so
that you're trying to build.  If, instead, libperl.so is tucked away in
$archlib, then you can always just change $archlib in the current perl
you're trying to build so that ld.so won't find your old libperl.so.
(The INSTALL file suggests you do this when building a debugging perl.)
<li class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_2"></a>

The shared perl library is not a &quot;well-behaved&quot; shared library with
proper major and minor version numbers, so you can't necessarily
have perl5.004_04 and perl5.004_05 installed simultaneously.  Suppose
perl5.004_04 were to install /usr/lib/libperl.so.4.4, and perl5.004_05
were to install /usr/lib/libperl.so.4.5.  Now, when you try to run
perl5.004_04, ld.so might try to load libperl.so.4.5, since it has
the right &quot;major version&quot; number.  If this works at all, it almost
certainly defeats the reason for keeping perl5.004_04 around.  Worse,
with development subversions, you certaily can't guarantee that
libperl.so.4.4 and libperl.so.4.55 will be compatible.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Anyway, all this leads to quite obscure failures that are sure to drive
casual users crazy.  Even experienced users will get confused :-).  Upon
reflection, I'd say leave libperl.so in $archlib.
