</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The normal way to run a Perl program is by making it directly
executable, or else by passing the name of the source file as an
argument on the command line.  (An interactive Perl environment
is also possible--see the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perldebug.html">perldebug</a> manpage for details on how to do that.)
Upon startup, Perl looks for your program in one of the following
places:
</p>
<ol class="POD_LIST">
<li class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_"></a>

Specified line by line via <b>-e</b> switches on the command line.
<li class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_1"></a>

Contained in the file specified by the first filename on the command line.
(Note that systems supporting the #! notation invoke interpreters this
way. See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="#Location_of_Perl">Location of Perl</a> entry elsewhere in this document.)
<li class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_2"></a>

Passed in implicitly via standard input.  This works only if there are
no filename arguments--to pass arguments to a STDIN-read program you
must explicitly specify a &quot;-&quot; for the program name.
</ol>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
With methods 2 and 3, Perl starts parsing the input file from the
beginning, unless you've specified a <b>-x</b> switch, in which case it
scans for the first line starting with #! and containing the word
&quot;perl&quot;, and starts there instead.  This is useful for running a program
embedded in a larger message.  (In this case you would indicate the end
of the program using the <code>__END__</code> token.)
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The #! line is always examined for switches as the line is being
parsed.  Thus, if you're on a machine that allows only one argument
with the #! line, or worse, doesn't even recognize the #! line, you
still can get consistent switch behavior regardless of how Perl was
invoked, even if <b>-x</b> was used to find the beginning of the program.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Because historically some operating systems silently chopped off
kernel interpretation of the #! line after 32 characters, some
switches may be passed in on the command line, and some may not;
you could even get a &quot;-&quot; without its letter, if you're not careful.
You probably want to make sure that all your switches fall either
before or after that 32-character boundary.  Most switches don't
actually care if they're processed redundantly, but getting a &quot;-&quot;
instead of a complete switch could cause Perl to try to execute
standard input instead of your program.  And a partial <b>-I</b> switch
could also cause odd results.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Some switches do care if they are processed twice, for instance
combinations of <b>-l</b> and <b>-0</b>.  Either put all the switches after
the 32-character boundary (if applicable), or replace the use of
<b>-0</b><i>digits</i> by <code>BEGIN{ $/ = &quot;\0digits&quot;; }</code>.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Parsing of the #! switches starts wherever &quot;perl&quot; is mentioned in the line.
The sequences &quot;-*&quot; and &quot;- &quot; are specifically ignored so that you could,
if you were so inclined, say

    #!/bin/sh -- # -*- perl -*- -p
    eval 'exec perl -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
        if $running_under_some_shell;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
to let Perl see the <b>-p</b> switch.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
A similar trick involves the <b>env</b> program, if you have it.

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The examples above use a relative path to the perl interpreter,
getting whatever version is first in the user's path.  If you want
a specific version of Perl, say, perl5.005_57, you should place
that directly in the #! line's path.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If the #! line does not contain the word &quot;perl&quot;, the program named after
the #! is executed instead of the Perl interpreter.  This is slightly
bizarre, but it helps people on machines that don't do #!, because they
can tell a program that their SHELL is <code>/usr/bin/perl</code>, and Perl will then
dispatch the program to the correct interpreter for them.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
After locating your program, Perl compiles the entire program to an
internal form.  If there are any compilation errors, execution of the
program is not attempted.  (This is unlike the typical shell script,
which might run part-way through before finding a syntax error.)
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If the program is syntactically correct, it is executed.  If the program
runs off the end without hitting an exit() or die() operator, an implicit
<code>exit(0)</code> is provided to indicate successful completion.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="_and_quoting_on_non_">#! and quoting on non-Unix systems</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Unix's #! technique can be simulated on other systems:
</p>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="OS_2">OS/2</a>
<dd>
Put
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    extproc perl -S -your_switches
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
as the first line in <code>*.cmd</code> file (<b>-S</b> due to a bug in cmd.exe's
`extproc' handling).
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="MS_DOS">MS-DOS</a>
<dd>
Create a batch file to run your program, and codify it in
<code>ALTERNATIVE_SHEBANG</code> (see the <code>dosish.h</code> file in the source
distribution for more information).
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Win95_NT">Win95/NT</a>
<dd>
The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState installer for Perl,
will modify the Registry to associate the <code>.pl</code> extension with the perl
interpreter.  If you install Perl by other means (including building from
the sources), you may have to modify the Registry yourself.  Note that
this means you can no longer tell the difference between an executable
Perl program and a Perl library file.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Macintosh">Macintosh</a>
<dd>
A Macintosh perl program will have the appropriate Creator and
Type, so that double-clicking them will invoke the perl application.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="VMS">VMS</a>
<dd>
Put
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    $ perl -mysw 'f$env(&quot;procedure&quot;)' 'p1' 'p2' 'p3' 'p4' 'p5' 'p6' 'p7' 'p8' !
    $ exit++ + ++$status != 0 and $exit = $status = undef;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
at the top of your program, where <b>-mysw</b> are any command line switches you
want to pass to Perl.  You can now invoke the program directly, by saying
<code>perl program</code>, or as a DCL procedure, by saying <code>@program</code> (or implicitly
via <code>DCL$PATH</code> by just using the name of the program).
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This incantation is a bit much to remember, but Perl will display it for
you if you say <code>perl &quot;-V:startperl&quot;</code>.
</p>
</dl>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Command-interpreters on non-Unix systems have rather different ideas
on quoting than Unix shells.  You'll need to learn the special
characters in your command-interpreter (<code>*</code>, <code>\</code> and <code>&quot;</code> are
common) and how to protect whitespace and these characters to run
one-liners (see <b>-e</b> below).
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
On some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to double ones,
which you must <i>not</i> do on Unix or Plan9 systems.  You might also
have to change a single % to a %%.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
For example:

    # Unix
    perl -e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'

    # MS-DOS, etc.
    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;Hello world\n\&quot;&quot;

    # Macintosh
    print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;
     (then Run &quot;Myscript&quot; or Shift-Command-R)

    # VMS
    perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello world\n&quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The problem is that none of this is reliable: it depends on the
command and it is entirely possible neither works.  If <b>4DOS</b> were
the command shell, this would probably work better:

    perl -e &quot;print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
<b>CMD.EXE</b> in Windows NT slipped a lot of standard Unix functionality in
when nobody was looking, but just try to find documentation for its
quoting rules.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Under the Macintosh, it depends which environment you are using.  The MacPerl
shell, or MPW, is much like Unix shells in its support for several
quoting variants, except that it makes free use of the Macintosh's non-ASCII
characters as control characters.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
There is no general solution to all of this.  It's just a mess.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Location_of_Perl">Location of Perl</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
It may seem obvious to say, but Perl is useful only when users can
easily find it.  When possible, it's good for both <code>/usr/bin/perl</code>
and <code>/usr/local/bin/perl</code> to be symlinks to the actual binary.  If
that can't be done, system administrators are strongly encouraged
to put (symlinks to) perl and its accompanying utilities into a
directory typically found along a user's PATH, or in some other
obvious and convenient place.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In this documentation, <code>#!/usr/bin/perl</code> on the first line of the program
will stand in for whatever method works on your system.  You are
advised to use a specific path if you care about a specific version.

    #!/usr/local/bin/perl5.00554
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
or if you just want to be running at least version, place a statement
like this at the top of your program:

    use 5.005_54;
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Command_Switches">Command Switches</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
As with all standard commands, a single-character switch may be
clustered with the following switch, if any.

    #!/usr/bin/perl -spi.orig	# same as -s -p -i.orig
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Switches include:
</p>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_0_digits_"><b>-0</b>[<i>digits</i>]</a>
<dd>
specifies the input record separator (<code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_14">$/</a></code>) as an octal number.  If there are
no digits, the null character is the separator.  Other switches may
precede or follow the digits.  For example, if you have a version of
<b>find</b> which can print filenames terminated by the null character, you
can say this:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    find . -name '*.orig' -print0 | perl -n0e unlink
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The special value 00 will cause Perl to slurp files in paragraph mode.
The value 0777 will cause Perl to slurp files whole because there is no
legal character with that value.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_a"><b>-a</b></a>
<dd>
turns on autosplit mode when used with a <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b>.  An implicit
split command to the @F array is done as the first thing inside the
implicit while loop produced by the <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b>.
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    perl -ane 'print pop(@F), &quot;\n&quot;;'
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
is equivalent to

    while (&lt;&gt;) {
	@F = split(' ');
	print pop(@F), &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
An alternate delimiter may be specified using <b>-F</b>.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_C"><b>-C</b></a>
<dd>
enables Perl to use the native wide character APIs on the target system.
The magic variable <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_WIDE_SYSTEM_CALLS_">${^WIDE_SYSTEM_CALLS}</a></code> reflects the state of
this switch.  See the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_WIDE_SYSTEM_CALLS_">${^WIDE_SYSTEM_CALLS}</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a> manpage.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This feature is currently only implemented on the Win32 platform.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_c"><b>-c</b></a>
<dd>
causes Perl to check the syntax of the program and then exit without
executing it.  Actually, it <i>will</i> execute <code>BEGIN</code>, <code>CHECK</code>, and
<code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#use_Module_LIST">use</a></code> blocks, because these are considered as occurring outside the
execution of your program.  <code>INIT</code> and <code>END</code> blocks, however, will
be skipped.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_d"><b>-d</b></a>
<dd>
runs the program under the Perl debugger.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perldebug.html">perldebug</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_d_foo_bar_baz_"><b>-d:</b><i>foo[=bar,baz]</i></a>
<dd>
runs the program under the control of a debugging, profiling, or
tracing module installed as Devel::foo. E.g., <b>-d:DProf</b> executes
the program using the Devel::DProf profiler.  As with the <b>-M</b>
flag, options may be passed to the Devel::foo package where they
will be received and interpreted by the Devel::foo::import routine.
The comma-separated list of options must follow a <code>=</code> character.
See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perldebug.html">perldebug</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_Dletters"><b>-D</b><i>letters</i></a>
<dt><a name="_Dnumber"><b>-D</b><i>number</i></a>
<dd>
sets debugging flags.  To watch how it executes your program, use
<b>-Dtls</b>.  (This works only if debugging is compiled into your
Perl.)  Another nice value is <b>-Dx</b>, which lists your compiled
syntax tree.  And <b>-Dr</b> displays compiled regular expressions. As an
alternative, specify a number instead of list of letters (e.g., <b>-D14</b> is
equivalent to <b>-Dtls</b>):

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_i_extension_"><b>-i</b>[<i>extension</i>]</a>
<dd>
specifies that files processed by the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> construct are to be
edited in-place.  It does this by renaming the input file, opening the
output file by the original name, and selecting that output file as the
default for print() statements.  The extension, if supplied, is used to
modify the name of the old file to make a backup copy, following these
rules:
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If no extension is supplied, no backup is made and the current file is
overwritten.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If the extension doesn't contain a <code>*</code>, then it is appended to the
end of the current filename as a suffix.  If the extension does
contain one or more <code>*</code> characters, then each <code>*</code> is replaced
with the current filename.  In Perl terms, you could think of this
as:

    ($backup = $extension) =~ s/\*/$file_name/g;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This allows you to add a prefix to the backup file, instead of (or in
addition to) a suffix:

    $ perl -pi 'orig_*' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA	# backup to 'orig_fileA'
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Or even to place backup copies of the original files into another
directory (provided the directory already exists):

    $ perl -pi 'old/*.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA # backup to 'old/fileA.orig'
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
These sets of one-liners are equivalent:

    $ perl -pi -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA		# overwrite current file
    $ perl -pi '*' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA	# overwrite current file

    $ perl -pi '.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA	# backup to 'fileA.orig'
    $ perl -pi '*.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA	# backup to 'fileA.orig'
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
From the shell, saying

    $ perl -p -i.orig -e &quot;s/foo/bar/; ... &quot;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
is the same as using the program:

    #!/usr/bin/perl -pi.orig
    s/foo/bar/;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
which is equivalent to

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    $extension = '.orig';
    LINE: while (&lt;&gt;) {
	if ($ARGV ne $oldargv) {
	    if ($extension !~ /\*/) {
		$backup = $ARGV . $extension;
	    }
	    else {
		($backup = $extension) =~ s/\*/$ARGV/g;
	    }
	    rename($ARGV, $backup);
	    open(ARGVOUT, &quot;&gt;$ARGV&quot;);
	    select(ARGVOUT);
	    $oldargv = $ARGV;
	}
	s/foo/bar/;
    }
    continue {
	print;	# this prints to original filename
    }
    select(STDOUT);
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
except that the <b>-i</b> form doesn't need to compare $ARGV to $oldargv to
know when the filename has changed.  It does, however, use ARGVOUT for
the selected filehandle.  Note that STDOUT is restored as the default
output filehandle after the loop.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
As shown above, Perl creates the backup file whether or not any output
is actually changed.  So this is just a fancy way to copy files:

    $ perl -p -i '/some/file/path/*' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...
or
    $ perl -p -i '.orig' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
You can use <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#eof">eof</a></code> without parentheses to locate the end of each input
file, in case you want to append to each file, or reset line numbering
(see example in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#eof">eof</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage).
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If, for a given file, Perl is unable to create the backup file as
specified in the extension then it will skip that file and continue on
with the next one (if it exists).
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
For a discussion of issues surrounding file permissions and <b>-i</b>,
see the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfaq5.html#Why_does_Perl_let_me">Why does Perl let me delete read-only files? Why does -i clobber protected files? Isn't this a bug in Perl?</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfaq5.html">perlfaq5</a> manpage.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
You cannot use <b>-i</b> to create directories or to strip extensions from
files.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Perl does not expand <code>~</code> in filenames, which is good, since some
folks use it for their backup files:

    $ perl -pi~ -e 's/foo/bar/' file1 file2 file3...
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Finally, the <b>-i</b> switch does not impede execution when no
files are given on the command line.  In this case, no backup is made
(the original file cannot, of course, be determined) and processing
proceeds from STDIN to STDOUT as might be expected.

that any print statements will have that separator added back on.
If <i>octnum</i> is omitted, sets <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_17">$\</a></code> to the current value of
<code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_14">$/</a></code>.  For instance, to trim lines to 80 columns:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    perl -lpe 'substr($_, 80) = &quot;&quot;'
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Note that the assignment <code>$\ = $/</code> is done when the switch is processed,
so the input record separator can be different than the output record
separator if the <b>-l</b> switch is followed by a <b>-0</b> switch:

    gnufind / -print0 | perl -ln0e 'print &quot;found $_&quot; if -p'
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This sets <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_17">$\</a></code> to newline and then sets <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_14">$/</a></code> to the null character.

causes your program to be run through the C preprocessor before
compilation by Perl.  Because both comments and <b>cpp</b> directives begin
with the # character, you should avoid starting comments with any words
recognized by the C preprocessor such as <code>&quot;if&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;else&quot;</code>, or <code>&quot;define&quot;</code>.
Also, in some platforms the C preprocessor knows too much: it knows
about the C++ -style until-end-of-line comments starting with <code>&quot;//&quot;</code>.
This will cause problems with common Perl constructs like
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    s/foo//;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
because after -P this will became illegal code

    s/foo
</pre>

The workaround is to use some other quoting separator than <code>&quot;/&quot;</code>,
like for example <code>&quot;!&quot;</code>:

enables rudimentary switch parsing for switches on the command
line after the program name but before any filename arguments (or before
an argument of <b>--</b>).  This means you can have switches with two leading
dashes (<b>--help</b>).  Any switch found there is removed from @ARGV and sets the
corresponding variable in the Perl program.  The following program
prints &quot;1&quot; if the program is invoked with a <b>-xyz</b> switch, and &quot;abc&quot;
if it is invoked with <b>-xyz=abc</b>.
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    #!/usr/bin/perl -s
    if ($xyz) { print &quot;$xyz\n&quot; }

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_S"><b>-S</b></a>
<dd>
makes Perl use the PATH environment variable to search for the
program (unless the name of the program contains directory separators).
<p class="POD_TEXT">
On some platforms, this also makes Perl append suffixes to the
filename while searching for it.  For example, on Win32 platforms,
the &quot;.bat&quot; and &quot;.cmd&quot; suffixes are appended if a lookup for the
original name fails, and if the name does not already end in one
of those suffixes.  If your Perl was compiled with DEBUGGING turned
on, using the -Dp switch to Perl shows how the search progresses.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Typically this is used to emulate #! startup on platforms that
don't support #!.  This example works on many platforms that
have a shell compatible with Bourne shell:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
	    if $running_under_some_shell;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The system ignores the first line and feeds the program to <code>/bin/sh</code>,
which proceeds to try to execute the Perl program as a shell script.
The shell executes the second line as a normal shell command, and thus
starts up the Perl interpreter.  On some systems $0 doesn't always
contain the full pathname, so the <b>-S</b> tells Perl to search for the
program if necessary.  After Perl locates the program, it parses the
lines and ignores them because the variable $running_under_some_shell
is never true.  If the program will be interpreted by csh, you will need
to replace <code>${1+&quot;$@&quot;}</code> with <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_12">$*</a></code>, even though that doesn't understand
embedded spaces (and such) in the argument list.  To start up sh rather
than csh, some systems may have to replace the #! line with a line
containing just a colon, which will be politely ignored by Perl.  Other
systems can't control that, and need a totally devious construct that
will work under any of <b>csh</b>, <b>sh</b>, or Perl, such as the following:

	eval '(exit $?0)' &amp;&amp; eval 'exec perl -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
	&amp; eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 $argv:q'
		if $running_under_some_shell;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If the filename supplied contains directory separators (i.e., is an
absolute or relative pathname), and if that file is not found,
platforms that append file extensions will do so and try to look
for the file with those extensions added, one by one.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
On DOS-like platforms, if the program does not contain directory
separators, it will first be searched for in the current directory
before being searched for on the PATH.  On Unix platforms, the
program will be searched for strictly on the PATH.

forces &quot;taint&quot; checks to be turned on so you can test them.  Ordinarily
these checks are done only when running setuid or setgid.  It's a
good idea to turn them on explicitly for programs that run on behalf
of someone else whom you might not necessarily trust, such as CGI
programs or any internet servers you might write in Perl.  See
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a> manpage for details.  For security reasons, this option must be
seen by Perl quite early; usually this means it must appear early
on the command line or in the #! line for systems which support
that construct.

This obsolete switch causes Perl to dump core after compiling your
program.  You can then in theory take this core dump and turn it
into an executable file by using the <b>undump</b> program (not supplied).
This speeds startup at the expense of some disk space (which you
can minimize by stripping the executable).  (Still, a &quot;hello world&quot;
executable comes out to about 200K on my machine.)  If you want to
execute a portion of your program before dumping, use the dump()
operator instead.  Note: availability of <b>undump</b> is platform
specific and may not be available for a specific port of Perl.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This switch has been superseded in favor of the new Perl code
generator backends to the compiler.  See the <u>B</u> manpage and the <u>B::Bytecode</u> manpage

tells Perl that the program is embedded in a larger chunk of unrelated
ASCII text, such as in a mail message.  Leading garbage will be
discarded until the first line that starts with #! and contains the

If a directory name is specified, Perl will switch to that directory
before running the program.  The <b>-x</b> switch controls only the
disposal of leading garbage.  The program must be terminated with
<code>__END__</code> if there is trailing garbage to be ignored (the program
can process any or all of the trailing garbage via the DATA filehandle
if desired).

Note that Perl doesn't use COMSPEC for this purpose because
COMSPEC has a high degree of variability among users, leading to
