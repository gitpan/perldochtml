perlfaq8 - System Interaction ($Revision: 1.39 $, $Date: 1999/05/23 18:37:57 $)
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This section of the Perl FAQ covers questions involving operating
system interaction.  Topics include interprocess communication (IPC),
control over the user-interface (keyboard, screen and pointing
devices), and most anything else not related to data manipulation.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Read the FAQs and documentation specific to the port of perl to your
operating system (eg, the <u>perlvms</u> manpage, the <u>perlplan9</u> manpage, ...).  These should
contain more detailed information on the vagaries of your perl.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_find_out_wh">How do I find out which operating system I'm running under?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The $^O variable ($OSNAME if you use English) contains an indication of
the name of the operating system (not its release number) that your perl
binary was built for.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_come_exec_doesn_">How come exec() doesn't return?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Because that's what it does: it replaces your currently running
program with a different one.  If you want to keep going (as is
probably the case if you're asking this question) use system()
instead.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_do_fancy_st">How do I do fancy stuff with the keyboard/screen/mouse?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
How you access/control keyboards, screens, and pointing devices
(&quot;mice&quot;) is system-dependent.  Try the following modules:
</p>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Keyboard">Keyboard</a>
<dd><pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    <a class="POD_LINK" href="Term/Cap.html">Term::Cap</a>			Standard perl distribution
    Term::ReadKey		CPAN
    Term::ReadLine::Gnu		CPAN
    Term::ReadLine::Perl	CPAN
    Term::Screen		CPAN
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Screen">Screen</a>
<dd><pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    <a class="POD_LINK" href="Term/Cap.html">Term::Cap</a>			Standard perl distribution
    Curses			CPAN
    <a class="POD_LINK" href="Term/ANSIColor.html">Term::ANSIColor</a>		CPAN
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Mouse">Mouse</a>
<dd><pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    Tk				CPAN
</pre>
</dl>

Some of these specific cases are shown below.
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_print_somet">How do I print something out in color?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In general, you don't, because you don't know whether
the recipient has a color-aware display device.  If you
know that they have an ANSI terminal that understands
color, you can use the Term::ANSIColor module from CPAN:

    use Term::ANSIColor;
    print color(&quot;red&quot;), &quot;Stop!\n&quot;, color(&quot;reset&quot;);
    print color(&quot;green&quot;), &quot;Go!\n&quot;, color(&quot;reset&quot;);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Or like this:

    use Term::ANSIColor qw(:constants);
    print RED, &quot;Stop!\n&quot;, RESET;
    print GREEN, &quot;Go!\n&quot;, RESET;
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_read_just_o">How do I read just one key without waiting for a return key?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Controlling input buffering is a remarkably system-dependent matter.
On many systems, you can just use the <b>stty</b> command as shown in
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#getc">getc</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage, but as you see, that's already getting you into
portability snags.

    open(TTY, &quot;+&lt;/dev/tty&quot;) or die &quot;no tty: $!&quot;;
    system &quot;stty  cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;;
    $key = getc(TTY);		# perhaps this works
    # OR ELSE
    sysread(TTY, $key, 1);	# probably this does
    system &quot;stty -cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The Term::ReadKey module from CPAN offers an easy-to-use interface that
should be more efficient than shelling out to <b>stty</b> for each key.
It even includes limited support for Windows.

    use Term::ReadKey;
    ReadMode('cbreak');
    $key = ReadKey(0);
    ReadMode('normal');
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
However, using the code requires that you have a working C compiler
and can use it to build and install a CPAN module.  Here's a solution
using the standard POSIX module, which is already on your systems
(assuming your system supports POSIX).

    use HotKey;
    $key = readkey();
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
And here's the HotKey module, which hides the somewhat mystifying calls
to manipulate the POSIX termios structures.

    # HotKey.pm
    package HotKey;

    @ISA = qw(Exporter);
    @EXPORT = qw(cbreak cooked readkey);

    use strict;
    use POSIX qw(:termios_h);
    my ($term, $oterm, $echo, $noecho, $fd_stdin);

    $fd_stdin = fileno(STDIN);
    $term     = POSIX::Termios-&gt;new();
    $term-&gt;getattr($fd_stdin);
    $oterm     = $term-&gt;getlflag();

    $echo     = ECHO | ECHOK | ICANON;
    $noecho   = $oterm &amp; ~$echo;

    sub cbreak {
        $term-&gt;setlflag($noecho);  # ok, so i don't want echo either
        $term-&gt;setcc(VTIME, 1);
        $term-&gt;setattr($fd_stdin, TCSANOW);
    }

    sub cooked {
        $term-&gt;setlflag($oterm);
        $term-&gt;setcc(VTIME, 0);
        $term-&gt;setattr($fd_stdin, TCSANOW);
    }

    sub readkey {
        my $key = '';
        cbreak();
        sysread(STDIN, $key, 1);
        cooked();
        return $key;
    }

    END { cooked() }

    1;
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_check_wheth">How do I check whether input is ready on the keyboard?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The easiest way to do this is to read a key in nonblocking mode with the
Term::ReadKey module from CPAN, passing it an argument of -1 to indicate
not to block:

    use Term::ReadKey;

    ReadMode('cbreak');

    if (defined ($char = ReadKey(-1)) ) {
        # input was waiting and it was $char
    } else {
        # no input was waiting
    }

    ReadMode('normal');                  # restore normal tty settings
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_clear_the_s">How do I clear the screen?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you only have do so infrequently, use <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#system_LIST">system</a></code>:

    system(&quot;clear&quot;);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you have to do this a lot, save the clear string
so you can print it 100 times without calling a program
100 times:

    $clear_string = `clear`;
    print $clear_string;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you're planning on doing other screen manipulations, like cursor
positions, etc, you might wish to use Term::Cap module:

    use Term::Cap;
    $terminal = Term::Cap-&gt;Tgetent( {OSPEED =&gt; 9600} );
    $clear_string = $terminal-&gt;Tputs('cl');
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_get_the_scr">How do I get the screen size?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
If you have Term::ReadKey module installed from CPAN, 
you can use it to fetch the width and height in characters
and in pixels:

    use Term::ReadKey;
    ($wchar, $hchar, $wpixels, $hpixels) = GetTerminalSize();
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This is more portable than the raw <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#ioctl_FILEHANDLE_FUN">ioctl</a></code>, but not as 
illustrative:

    require 'sys/ioctl.ph';
    die &quot;no TIOCGWINSZ &quot; unless defined &amp;TIOCGWINSZ;
    open(TTY, &quot;+&lt;/dev/tty&quot;)                     or die &quot;No tty: $!&quot;;
    unless (ioctl(TTY, &amp;TIOCGWINSZ, $winsize='')) {
        die sprintf &quot;$0: ioctl TIOCGWINSZ (%08x: $!)\n&quot;, &amp;TIOCGWINSZ;
    }
    ($row, $col, $xpixel, $ypixel) = unpack('S4', $winsize);
    print &quot;(row,col) = ($row,$col)&quot;;
    print &quot;  (xpixel,ypixel) = ($xpixel,$ypixel)&quot; if $xpixel || $ypixel;
    print &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_ask_the_use">How do I ask the user for a password?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
(This question has nothing to do with the web.  See a different
FAQ for that.)
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
There's an example of this in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#crypt_PLAINTEXT_SALT">crypt</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage).  First, you put the
terminal into &quot;no echo&quot; mode, then just read the password normally.
You may do this with an old-style ioctl() function, POSIX terminal
control (see the <u>POSIX</u> manpage or its documentation the Camel Book), or a call
to the <b>stty</b> program, with varying degrees of portability.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
You can also do this for most systems using the Term::ReadKey module
from CPAN, which is easier to use and in theory more portable.

    use Term::ReadKey;

    ReadMode('noecho');
    $password = ReadLine(0);
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_read_and_wr">How do I read and write the serial port?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This depends on which operating system your program is running on.  In
the case of Unix, the serial ports will be accessible through files in
/dev; on other systems, device names will doubtless differ.
Several problem areas common to all device interaction are the
following:
</p>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="lockfiles">lockfiles</a>
<dd>
Your system may use lockfiles to control multiple access.  Make sure
you follow the correct protocol.  Unpredictable behavior can result
from multiple processes reading from one device.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="open_mode">open mode</a>
<dd>
If you expect to use both read and write operations on the device,
you'll have to open it for update (see the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage for
details).  You may wish to open it without running the risk of
blocking by using sysopen() and <code>O_RDWR|O_NDELAY|O_NOCTTY</code> from the
Fcntl module (part of the standard perl distribution).  See
the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#sysopen_FILEHANDLE_F">sysopen</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage for more on this approach.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="end_of_line">end of line</a>
<dd>
Some devices will be expecting a &quot;\r&quot; at the end of each line rather
than a &quot;\n&quot;.  In some ports of perl, &quot;\r&quot; and &quot;\n&quot; are different from
their usual (Unix) ASCII values of &quot;\012&quot; and &quot;\015&quot;.  You may have to
give the numeric values you want directly, using octal (&quot;\015&quot;), hex
(&quot;0x0D&quot;), or as a control-character specification (&quot;\cM&quot;).
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    print DEV &quot;atv1\012&quot;;	# wrong, for some devices
    print DEV &quot;atv1\015&quot;;	# right, for some devices
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Even though with normal text files a &quot;\n&quot; will do the trick, there is
still no unified scheme for terminating a line that is portable
between Unix, DOS/Win, and Macintosh, except to terminate <i>ALL</i> line
ends with &quot;\015\012&quot;, and strip what you don't need from the output.
This applies especially to socket I/O and autoflushing, discussed
next.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="flushing_output">flushing output</a>
<dd>
If you expect characters to get to your device when you print() them,
you'll want to autoflush that filehandle.  You can use select()
and the <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_15">$|</a></code> variable to control autoflushing (see the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_15">$|</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a> manpage
and the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#select">select</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage, or the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfaq5.html">perlfaq5</a> manpage, ``How do I flush/unbuffer an
output filehandle?  Why must I do this?''):
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    $oldh = select(DEV);
    $| = 1;
    select($oldh);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
You'll also see code that does this without a temporary variable, as in

    select((select(DEV), $| = 1)[0]);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Or if you don't mind pulling in a few thousand lines
of code just because you're afraid of a little $| variable:

    use IO::Handle;
    DEV-&gt;autoflush(1);
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
As mentioned in the previous item, this still doesn't work when using
socket I/O between Unix and Macintosh.  You'll need to hardcode your
line terminators, in that case.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="non_blocking_input">non-blocking input</a>
<dd>
If you are doing a blocking read() or sysread(), you'll have to
arrange for an alarm handler to provide a timeout (see
the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#alarm">alarm</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage).  If you have a non-blocking open, you'll likely
have a non-blocking read, which means you may have to use a 4-arg
select() to determine whether I/O is ready on that device (see
the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#select">select</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
</dl>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
While trying to read from his caller-id box, the notorious Jamie Zawinski
&lt;jwz@netscape.com&gt;, after much gnashing of teeth and fighting with sysread,
sysopen, POSIX's tcgetattr business, and various other functions that
go bump in the night, finally came up with this:

    sub open_modem {
	use IPC::Open2;
	my $stty = `/bin/stty -g`;
	open2( \*MODEM_IN, \*MODEM_OUT, &quot;cu -l$modem_device -s2400 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;);
	# starting cu hoses /dev/tty's stty settings, even when it has
	# been opened on a pipe...
	system(&quot;/bin/stty $stty&quot;);
	$_ = &lt;MODEM_IN&gt;;
	chomp;
	if ( !m/^Connected/ ) {
	    print STDERR &quot;$0: cu printed `$_' instead of `Connected'\n&quot;;
	}
    }

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_decode_encr">How do I decode encrypted password files?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
You spend lots and lots of money on dedicated hardware, but this is
bound to get you talked about.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Seriously, you can't if they are Unix password files--the Unix
password system employs one-way encryption.  It's more like hashing than
encryption.  The best you can check is whether something else hashes to
the same string.  You can't turn a hash back into the original string.
Programs like Crack
can forcibly (and intelligently) try to guess passwords, but don't
(can't) guarantee quick success.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you're worried about users selecting bad passwords, you should
proactively check when they try to change their password (by modifying
passwd(1), for example).
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_start_a_pro">How do I start a process in the background?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
You could use

    system(&quot;cmd &amp;&quot;)
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
or you could use fork as documented in the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#fork">fork</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage, with
further examples in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlipc.html">perlipc</a> manpage.  Some things to be aware of, if you're
on a Unix-like system:
</p>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="STDIN_STDOUT_and_STD">STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR are shared</a>
<dd>
Both the main process and the backgrounded one (the &quot;child&quot; process)
share the same STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR filehandles.  If both try to
access them at once, strange things can happen.  You may want to close
or reopen these for the child.  You can get around this with
<code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a></code>ing a pipe (see the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage) but on some systems this
means that the child process cannot outlive the parent.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Signals">Signals</a>
<dd>
You'll have to catch the SIGCHLD signal, and possibly SIGPIPE too.
SIGCHLD is sent when the backgrounded process finishes.  SIGPIPE is
sent when you write to a filehandle whose child process has closed (an
untrapped SIGPIPE can cause your program to silently die).  This is
not an issue with <code>system(&quot;cmd&amp;&quot;)</code>.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Zombies">Zombies</a>

<p class="POD_TEXT">
You don't actually &quot;trap&quot; a control character.  Instead, that character
generates a signal which is sent to your terminal's currently
foregrounded process group, which you then trap in your process.
Signals are documented in the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlipc.html#Signals">Signals</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlipc.html">perlipc</a> manpage and the
section on ``Signals'' in the Camel.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Be warned that very few C libraries are re-entrant.  Therefore, if you
attempt to print() in a handler that got invoked during another stdio
operation your internal structures will likely be in an
inconsistent state, and your program will dump core.  You can
sometimes avoid this by using syswrite() instead of print().
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Unless you're exceedingly careful, the only safe things to do inside a
signal handler are (1) set a variable and (2) exit.  In the first case,
you should only set a variable in such a way that malloc() is not
called (eg, by setting a variable that already has a value).
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
For example:

    $Interrupted = 0;	# to ensure it has a value
    $SIG{INT} = sub {
        $Interrupted++;
	syswrite(STDERR, &quot;ouch\n&quot;, 5);
    }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
However, because syscalls restart by default, you'll find that if
you're in a &quot;slow&quot; call, such as &lt;FH&gt;, read(), connect(), or
wait(), that the only way to terminate them is by &quot;longjumping&quot; out;
that is, by raising an exception.  See the time-out handler for a
blocking flock() in the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlipc.html#Signals">Signals</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlipc.html">perlipc</a> manpage or the section on ``Signals''

It doesn't work perfectly, but it usually gets most of the job done.
Simple files like <code>errno.h</code>, <code>syscall.h</code>, and <code>socket.h</code> were fine,

You're confusing the purpose of system() and backticks (``).  system()
runs a command and returns exit status information (as a 16 bit value:
the low 7 bits are the signal the process died from, if any, and
the high 8 bits are the actual exit value).  Backticks (``) run a
command and return what it sent to STDOUT.

    $exit_status   = system(&quot;mail-users&quot;);
    $output_string = `ls`;
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_can_I_capture_ST">How can I capture STDERR from an external command?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
There are three basic ways of running external commands:

    system $cmd;		# using system()
    $output = `$cmd`;		# using backticks (``)
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd |&quot;);	# using open()
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
With system(), both STDOUT and STDERR will go the same place as the
script's STDOUT and STDERR, unless the system() command redirects them.
Backticks and open() read <b>only</b> the STDOUT of your command.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
With any of these, you can change file descriptors before the call:

    open(STDOUT, &quot;&gt;logfile&quot;);
    system(&quot;ls&quot;);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
or you can use Bourne shell file-descriptor redirection:

    $output = `$cmd 2&gt;some_file`;
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;some_file |&quot;);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
You can also use file-descriptor redirection to make STDERR a
duplicate of STDOUT:

    $output = `$cmd 2&gt;&amp;1`;
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;&amp;1 |&quot;);
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Note that you <i>cannot</i> simply open STDERR to be a dup of STDOUT
in your Perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection.
This doesn't work:

    open(STDERR, &quot;&gt;&amp;STDOUT&quot;);
    $alloutput = `cmd args`;  # stderr still escapes
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This fails because the open() makes STDERR go to where STDOUT was
going at the time of the open().  The backticks then make STDOUT go to
a string, but don't change STDERR (which still goes to the old
STDOUT).
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Note that you <i>must</i> use Bourne shell (sh(1)) redirection syntax in

<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Ordering is important in all these examples.  That's because the shell
processes file descriptor redirections in strictly left to right order.

    system(&quot;prog args 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;tmpfile&quot;);

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Why_doesn_t_open_ret">Why doesn't open() return an error when a pipe open fails?</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Because the pipe open takes place in two steps: first Perl calls
fork() to start a new process, then this new process calls exec() to
run the program you really wanted to open.  The first step reports
success or failure to your process, so open() can only tell you
whether the fork() succeeded or not.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
To find out if the exec() step succeeded, you have to catch SIGCHLD
and wait() to get the exit status.  You should also catch SIGPIPE if
you're writing to the child--you may not have found out the exec()
failed by the time you write.  This is documented in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlipc.html">perlipc</a> manpage.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In some cases, even this won't work.  If the second argument to a
piped open() contains shell metacharacters, perl fork()s, then exec()s
a shell to decode the metacharacters and eventually run the desired
program.  Now when you call wait(), you only learn whether or not the
<i>shell</i> could be successfully started...it's best to avoid shell
metacharacters.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
On systems that follow the spawn() paradigm, open() <i>might</i> do what
you expect--unless perl uses a shell to start your command. In this
case the fork()/exec() description still applies.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="What_s_wrong_with_us">What's wrong with using backticks in a void context?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Strictly speaking, nothing.  Stylistically speaking, it's not a good
way to write maintainable code because backticks have a (potentially
humongous) return value, and you're ignoring it.  It's may also not be very
efficient, because you have to read in all the lines of output, allocate
memory for them, and then throw it away.  Too often people are lulled
to writing:

    `cp file file.bak`;

Consider this line:

To actually alter the visible command line, you can assign to the
variable $0 as documented in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a> manpage.  This won't work on all
operating systems, though.  Daemon programs like sendmail place their
state there, as in:

In the strictest sense, it can't be done--the script executes as a
different process from the shell it was started from.  Changes to a
process are not reflected in its parent--only in any children
created after the change.  There is shell magic that may allow you to
fake it by eval()ing the script's output in your shell; check out the

Assuming your system supports such things, just send an appropriate signal
to the process (see the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#kill_SIGNAL_LIST">kill</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage).  It's common to first send a TERM
signal, wait a little bit, and then send a KILL signal to finish it off.

If by daemon process you mean one that's detached (disassociated from

Open /dev/tty and use the TIOCNOTTY ioctl on it.  See the <u>tty</u>(4) manpage

function, so you don't have to worry about process groups.

On POSIX systems, you can test whether your own process group matches
the current process group of your controlling terminal as follows:

You can't.  You need to imitate the system() call (see the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlipc.html">perlipc</a> manpage for
sample code) and then have a signal handler for the INT signal that
passes the signal on to the subprocess.  Or you can check for it:

the CPAN module, or any well-behaved CPAN module for that matter, follow
these steps:
</p>
<ol class="POD_LIST">

If your version of perl is compiled without dynamic loading, then you
just need to replace step 3 (<b>make</b>) with <b>make perl</b> and you will
get a new <code>perl</code> binary with your extension linked in.

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="What_s_the_differenc">What's the difference between require and use?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Perl offers several different ways to include code from one file into
another.  Here are the deltas between the various inclusion constructs:

    1)  do $file is like eval `cat $file`, except the former
	1.1: searches @INC and updates %INC.
	1.2: bequeaths an *unrelated* lexical scope on the eval'ed code.

    2)  require $file is like do $file, except the former
	2.1: checks for redundant loading, skipping already loaded files.
	2.2: raises an exception on failure to find, compile, or execute $file.

    3)  require Module is like require &quot;Module.pm&quot;, except the former
	3.1: translates each &quot;::&quot; into your system's directory separator.
	3.2: primes the parser to disambiguate class Module as an indirect object.

    4)  use Module is like require Module, except the former
	4.1: loads the module at compile time, not run-time.
	4.2: imports symbols and semantics from that package to the current one.
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In general, you usually want <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#use_Module_LIST">use</a></code> and a proper Perl module.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_keep_my_own">How do I keep my own module/library directory?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
When you build modules, use the PREFIX option when generating
Makefiles:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/u/mydir/perl
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
then either set the PERL5LIB environment variable before you run
scripts that use the modules/libraries (see the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlrun.html">perlrun</a> manpage) or say

    use lib '/u/mydir/perl';
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This is almost the same as

    BEGIN {
	unshift(@INC, '/u/mydir/perl');
    }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
except that the lib module checks for machine-dependent subdirectories.

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_add_the_dir">How do I add the directory my program lives in to the module/library search path?</a></h3>

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="How_do_I_add_a_direc">How do I add a directory to my include path at runtime?</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Here are the suggested ways of modifying your include path:

    the PERLLIB environment variable
    the PERL5LIB environment variable
    the perl -Idir command line flag
    the use lib pragma, as in
        use lib &quot;$ENV{HOME}/myown_perllib&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The latter is particularly useful because it knows about machine
dependent architectures.  The lib.pm pragmatic module was first
included with the 5.002 release of Perl.

but other times it is not.  Modern programs <code>use Socket;</code> instead.
