perldelta - what's new for perl v5.6.0
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This document describes differences between the 5.005 release and the 5.6.0
release.
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="Core_Enhancements">Core Enhancements</a></h2>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Interpreter_cloning_">Interpreter cloning, threads, and concurrency</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Perl 5.6.0 introduces the beginnings of support for running multiple
interpreters concurrently in different threads.  In conjunction with
the perl_clone() API call, which can be used to selectively duplicate
the state of any given interpreter, it is possible to compile a
piece of code once in an interpreter, clone that interpreter
one or more times, and run all the resulting interpreters in distinct
threads.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
On the Windows platform, this feature is used to emulate fork() at the
interpreter level.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfork.html">perlfork</a> manpage for details about that.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This feature is still in evolution.  It is eventually meant to be used
to selectively clone a subroutine and data reachable from that
subroutine in a separate interpreter and run the cloned subroutine
in a separate thread.  Since there is no shared data between the
interpreters, little or no locking will be needed (unless parts of
the symbol table are explicitly shared).  This is obviously intended
to be an easy-to-use replacement for the existing threads support.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Support for cloning interpreters and interpreter concurrency can be
enabled using the -Dusethreads Configure option (see win32/Makefile for
how to enable it on Windows.)  The resulting perl executable will be
functionally identical to one that was built with -Dmultiplicity, but
the perl_clone() API call will only be available in the former.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
-Dusethreads enables the cpp macro USE_ITHREADS by default, which in turn
enables Perl source code changes that provide a clear separation between
the op tree and the data it operates with.  The former is immutable, and
can therefore be shared between an interpreter and all of its clones,
while the latter is considered local to each interpreter, and is therefore
copied for each clone.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Note that building Perl with the -Dusemultiplicity Configure option
is adequate if you wish to run multiple <b>independent</b> interpreters
concurrently in different threads.  -Dusethreads only provides the
additional functionality of the perl_clone() API call and other
support for running <b>cloned</b> interpreters concurrently.

    NOTE: This is an experimental feature.  Implementation details are
    subject to change.
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Lexically_scoped_war">Lexically scoped warning categories</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
You can now control the granularity of warnings emitted by perl at a finer
level using the <code>use warnings</code> pragma.  the <a class="POD_LINK" href="warnings.html">warnings</a> manpage and the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perllexwarn.html">perllexwarn</a> manpage
have copious documentation on this feature.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Unicode_and_UTF_8_su">Unicode and UTF-8 support</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Perl now uses UTF-8 as its internal representation for character
strings.  The <code>utf8</code> and <code>bytes</code> pragmas are used to control this support
in the current lexical scope.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlunicode.html">perlunicode</a> manpage, the <a class="POD_LINK" href="utf8.html">utf8</a> manpage and the <a class="POD_LINK" href="bytes.html">bytes</a> manpage for
more information.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
This feature is expected to evolve quickly to support some form of I/O
disciplines that can be used to specify the kind of input and output data
(bytes or characters).  Until that happens, additional modules from CPAN
will be needed to complete the toolkit for dealing with Unicode.

    NOTE: This should be considered an experimental feature.  Implementation
    details are subject to change.
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Support_for_interpol">Support for interpolating named characters</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The new <code>\N</code> escape interpolates named characters within strings.
For example, <code>&quot;Hi! \N{WHITE SMILING FACE}&quot;</code> evaluates to a string
with a unicode smiley face at the end.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="_our_declarations">&quot;our&quot; declarations</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
An &quot;our&quot; declaration introduces a value that can be best understood
as a lexically scoped symbolic alias to a global variable in the
package that was current where the variable was declared.  This is
mostly useful as an alternative to the <code>vars</code> pragma, but also provides
the opportunity to introduce typing and other attributes for such
variables.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#our_EXPR">our</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Support_for_strings_">Support for strings represented as a vector of ordinals</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Literals of the form <code>v1.2.3.4</code> are now parsed as a string composed
of characters with the specified ordinals.  This is an alternative, more
readable way to construct (possibly unicode) strings instead of
interpolating characters, as in <code>&quot;\x{1}\x{2}\x{3}\x{4}&quot;</code>.  The leading
<code>v</code> may be omitted if there are more than two ordinals, so <code>1.2.3</code> is
parsed the same as <code>v1.2.3</code>.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Strings written in this form are also useful to represent version &quot;numbers&quot;.
It is easy to compare such version &quot;numbers&quot; (which are really just plain
strings) using any of the usual string comparison operators <code>eq</code>, <code>ne</code>,
<code>lt</code>, <code>gt</code>, etc., or perform bitwise string operations on them using <code>|</code>,
<code>&amp;</code>, etc.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In conjunction with the new <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_V">$^V</a></code> magic variable (which contains
the perl version as a string), such literals can be used as a readable way
to check if you're running a particular version of Perl:

    # this will parse in older versions of Perl also
    if ($^V and $^V gt v5.6.0) {
        # new features supported
    }
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
<code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#require">require</a></code> and <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#use_Module_LIST">use</a></code> also have some special magic to support such literals.
They will be interpreted as a version rather than as a module name:

    require v5.6.0;		# croak if $^V lt v5.6.0
    use v5.6.0;			# same, but croaks at compile-time
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Alternatively, the <code>v</code> may be omitted if there is more than one dot:

    require 5.6.0;
    use 5.6.0;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Also, <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#sprintf_FORMAT_LIST">sprintf</a></code> and <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#printf_FORMAT_LIST">printf</a></code> support the Perl-specific format flag <code>%v</code>
to print ordinals of characters in arbitrary strings:

    printf &quot;v%vd&quot;, $^V;		# prints current version, such as &quot;v5.5.650&quot;
    printf &quot;%*vX&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, $addr;	# formats IPv6 address
    printf &quot;%*vb&quot;, &quot; &quot;, $bits;	# displays bitstring
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
See the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perldata.html#Scalar_value_constru">Scalar value constructors</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perldata.html">perldata</a> manpage for additional information.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Improved_Perl_versio">Improved Perl version numbering system</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Beginning with Perl version 5.6.0, the version number convention has been
changed to a &quot;dotted integer&quot; scheme that is more commonly found in open
source projects.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Maintenance versions of v5.6.0 will be released as v5.6.1, v5.6.2 etc.
The next development series following v5.6.0 will be numbered v5.7.x,
beginning with v5.7.0, and the next major production release following
v5.6.0 will be v5.8.0.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The English module now sets $PERL_VERSION to $^V (a string value) rather
than <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_37">$]</a></code> (a numeric value).  (This is a potential incompatibility.
Send us a report via perlbug if you are affected by this.)
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The v1.2.3 syntax is also now legal in Perl.
See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="#Support_for_strings_">Support for strings represented as a vector of ordinals</a> entry elsewhere in this document for more on that.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
To cope with the new versioning system's use of at least three significant
digits for each version component, the method used for incrementing the
subversion number has also changed slightly.  We assume that versions older
than v5.6.0 have been incrementing the subversion component in multiples of
10.  Versions after v5.6.0 will increment them by 1.  Thus, using the new
notation, 5.005_03 is the &quot;same&quot; as v5.5.30, and the first maintenance
version following v5.6.0 will be v5.6.1 (which should be read as being
equivalent to a floating point value of 5.006_001 in the older format,
stored in <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlvar.html#_37">$]</a></code>).
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="New_syntax_for_decla">New syntax for declaring subroutine attributes</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Formerly, if you wanted to mark a subroutine as being a method call or
as requiring an automatic lock() when it is entered, you had to declare
that with a <code>use attrs</code> pragma in the body of the subroutine.
That can now be accomplished with declaration syntax, like this:

    sub mymethod : locked method ;
    ...
    sub mymethod : locked method {
	...
    }

    sub othermethod :locked :method ;
    ...
    sub othermethod :locked :method {
	...
    }
</pre>
<p></p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
(Note how only the first <code>:</code> is mandatory, and whitespace surrounding
the <code>:</code> is optional.)
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
<code>AutoSplit.pm</code> and <code>SelfLoader.pm</code> have been updated to keep the attributes
with the stubs they provide.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="attributes.html">attributes</a> manpage.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="File_and_directory_h">File and directory handles can be autovivified</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Similar to how constructs such as <code>$x-&gt;[0]</code> autovivify a reference,
handle constructors (open(), opendir(), pipe(), socketpair(), sysopen(),
socket(), and accept()) now autovivify a file or directory handle
if the handle passed to them is an uninitialized scalar variable.  This
allows the constructs such as <code>open(my $fh, ...)</code> and <code>open(local $fh,...)</code>
to be used to create filehandles that will conveniently be closed
automatically when the scope ends, provided there are no other references
to them.  This largely eliminates the need for typeglobs when opening
filehandles that must be passed around, as in the following example:

    sub myopen {
        open my $fh, &quot;@_&quot;
	     or die &quot;Can't open '@_': $!&quot;;
	return $fh;
    }

    {
        my $f = myopen(&quot;&lt;/etc/motd&quot;);
	print &lt;$f&gt;;
	# $f implicitly closed here
    }
</pre>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="open_with_more_than_">open() with more than two arguments</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If open() is passed three arguments instead of two, the second argument
is used as the mode and the third argument is taken to be the file name.
This is primarily useful for protecting against unintended magic behavior
of the traditional two-argument form.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#open_FILEHANDLE">open</a> entry in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html">perlfunc</a> manpage.

Note that unless you have the case (a) you will have to configure

    NOTE: The Configure flags -Duselonglong and -Duse64bits have been
    deprecated.  Use -Duse64bitint instead.
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
There are actually two modes of 64-bitness: the first one is achieved
using Configure -Duse64bitint and the second one using Configure
-Duse64bitall.  The difference is that the first one is minimal and
the second one maximal.  The first works in more places than the second.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The <code>use64bitint</code> does only as much as is required to get 64-bit
integers into Perl (this may mean, for example, using &quot;long longs&quot;)
while your memory may still be limited to 2 gigabytes (because your
pointers could still be 32-bit).  Note that the name <code>64bitint</code> does
not imply that your C compiler will be using 64-bit <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#int">int</a></code>s (it might,
but it doesn't have to): the <code>use64bitint</code> means that you will be
able to have 64 bits wide scalar values.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The <code>use64bitall</code> goes all the way by attempting to switch also
integers (if it can), longs (and pointers) to being 64-bit.  This may
create an even more binary incompatible Perl than -Duse64bitint: the
resulting executable may not run at all in a 32-bit box, or you may
have to reboot/reconfigure/rebuild your operating system to be 64-bit
aware.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Natively 64-bit systems like Alpha and Cray need neither -Duse64bitint
nor -Duse64bitall.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Last but not least: note that due to Perl's habit of always using
floating point numbers, the quads are still not true integers.
When quads overflow their limits (0...18_446_744_073_709_551_615 unsigned,
-9_223_372_036_854_775_808...9_223_372_036_854_775_807 signed), they
are silently promoted to floating point numbers, after which they will
start losing precision (in their lower digits).

    NOTE: 64-bit support is still experimental on most platforms.
    Existing support only covers the LP64 data model.  In particular, the
    LLP64 data model is not yet supported.  64-bit libraries and system
    APIs on many platforms have not stabilized--your mileage may vary.

files you may also need to adjust your per-process (or your

especially if you intend to write such files.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Finally, in addition to your process/process group maximum filesize
limits, you may have quota limits on your filesystems that stop you

Adjusting your process/user/group/file system/operating system limits
is outside the scope of Perl core language.  For process limits, you
may try increasing the limits using your shell's limits/limit/ulimit

In previous versions of Perl, you couldn't cache objects so as

Another familiar problem is with circular references.  When an
object references itself, its reference count would never go
down to zero, and it would not get destroyed until the program
is about to exit.

Weak references solve this by allowing you to &quot;weaken&quot; any
reference, that is, make it not count towards the reference count.
When the last non-weak reference to an object is deleted, the object
is destroyed and all the weak references to the object are
automatically undef-ed.

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Arrays_now_always_in">Arrays now always interpolate into double-quoted strings</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In double-quoted strings, arrays now interpolate, no matter what.  The
behavior in earlier versions of perl 5 was that arrays would interpolate
into strings if the array had been mentioned before the string was
compiled, and otherwise Perl would raise a fatal compile-time error.
In versions 5.000 through 5.003, the error was

        Literal @example now requires backslash
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In versions 5.004_01 through 5.6.0, the error was

        In string, @example now must be written as \@example
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The idea here was to get people into the habit of writing
<code>&quot;fred\@example.com&quot;</code> when they wanted a literal <code>@</code> sign, just as
they have always written <code>&quot;Give me back my \$5&quot;</code> when they wanted a
literal <code>$</code> sign.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Starting with 5.6.1, when Perl now sees an <code>@</code> sign in a
double-quoted string, it <i>always</i> attempts to interpolate an array,
regardless of whether or not the array has been used or declared
already.  The fatal error has been downgraded to an optional warning:

        Possible unintended interpolation of @example in string
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This warns you that <code>&quot;fred@example.com&quot;</code> is going to turn into
<code>fred.com</code> if you don't backslash the <code>@</code>.

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="_Dusethreads_means_s">-Dusethreads means something different</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The -Dusethreads flag now enables the experimental interpreter-based thread

5.005 instead, you need to run Configure with &quot;-Dusethreads -Duse5005threads&quot;.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
As of v5.6.0, interpreter-threads support is still lacking a way to
create new threads from Perl (i.e., <code>use Thread;</code> will not work with
interpreter threads).  <code>use Thread;</code> continues to be available when you
specify the -Duse5005threads option to Configure, bugs and all.

    NOTE: Support for threads continues to be an experimental feature.
    Interfaces and implementation are subject to sudden and drastic changes.

<p class="POD_TEXT">
The Configure options enabling the use of threads and the use of
64-bitness are now more daring in the sense that they no more have an
explicit list of operating systems of known threads/64-bit
capabilities.  In other words: if your operating system has the
necessary APIs and datatypes, you should be able just to go ahead and
use them, for threads by Configure -Dusethreads, and for 64 bits
either explicitly by Configure -Duse64bitint or implicitly if your
system has 64-bit wide datatypes.  See also the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="#64_bit_support">64-bit support</a> elsewhere in this document.

You can use &quot;Configure -Uinstallusrbinperl&quot; which causes installperl

of locally-added modules, scripts, and manpages.  See the section on
Installation Directories in the INSTALL file for complete details.
For most users building and installing from source, the defaults should
be fine.

<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you previously used <code>Configure -Dsitelib</code> or <code>-Dsitearch</code> to set
special values for library directories, you might wish to consider using
the new <code>-Dsiteprefix</code> setting instead.  Also, if you wish to re-use a

</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Better support for building Perl under command.com in Windows 95

</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Scripts are read in binary mode by default to allow ByteLoader (and
the filter mechanism in general) to work properly.  For compatibility,
the DATA filehandle will be set to text mode if a carriage return is
detected at the end of the line containing the __END__ or __DATA__
token; if not, the DATA filehandle will be left open in binary mode.
Earlier versions always opened the DATA filehandle in text mode.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The glob() operator is implemented via the <code>File::Glob</code> extension,
which supports glob syntax of the C shell.  This increases the flexibility
of the glob() operator, but there may be compatibility issues for
programs that relied on the older globbing syntax.  If you want to
preserve compatibility with the older syntax, you might want to run
perl with <code>-MFile::DosGlob</code>.  For details and compatibility information,

This has been corrected.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Lexical lookups for variables appearing in <code>eval '...'</code> within
functions that were themselves called within an <code>eval '...'</code> were
searching the wrong place for lexicals.  The lexical search now
correctly ends at the subroutine's block boundary.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The use of <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#return">return</a></code> within <code>eval {...}</code> caused $@ not to be reset

<p class="POD_TEXT">
Parsing of here documents used to be flawed when they appeared as
the replacement expression in <code>eval 's/.../.../e'</code>.  This has
been fixed.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="All_compilation_erro">All compilation errors are true errors</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Some &quot;errors&quot; encountered at compile time were by necessity 
generated as warnings followed by eventual termination of the
program.  This enabled more such errors to be reported in a
single run, rather than causing a hard stop at the first error
that was encountered.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The mechanism for reporting such errors has been reimplemented
to queue compile-time errors and report them at the end of the
compilation as true errors rather than as warnings.  This fixes
cases where error messages leaked through in the form of warnings
when code was compiled at run time using <code>eval STRING</code>, and
also allows such errors to be reliably trapped using <code>eval &quot;...&quot;</code>.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Implicitly_closed_fi">Implicitly closed filehandles are safer</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Sometimes implicitly closed filehandles (as when they are localized,

<p></p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Behavior_of_list_sli">Behavior of list slices is more consistent</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
When taking a slice of a literal list (as opposed to a slice of
an array or hash), Perl used to return an empty list if the
result happened to be composed of all undef values.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
The new behavior is to produce an empty list if (and only if)
the original list was empty.  Consider the following example:

    @a = (1,undef,undef,2)[2,1,2];
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The old behavior would have resulted in @a having no elements.
The new behavior ensures it has three undefined elements.
</p>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
Note in particular that the behavior of slices of the following
cases remains unchanged:

    @a = ()[1,2];
    @a = (getpwent)[7,0];

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Failures_in_DESTROY_">Failures in DESTROY()</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
When code in a destructor threw an exception, it went unnoticed
in earlier versions of Perl, unless someone happened to be
looking in $@ just after the point the destructor happened to
run.  Such failures are now visible as warnings when warnings are
enabled.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Locale_bugs_fixed">Locale bugs fixed</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
printf() and sprintf() previously reset the numeric locale
back to the default &quot;C&quot; locale.  This has been fixed.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Numbers formatted according to the local numeric locale
(such as using a decimal comma instead of a decimal dot) caused
&quot;isn't numeric&quot; warnings, even while the operations accessing
those numbers produced correct results.  These warnings have been
discontinued.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Memory_leaks">Memory leaks</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The <code>eval 'return sub {...}'</code> construct could sometimes leak

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Spurious_subroutine_">Spurious subroutine stubs after failed subroutine calls</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Perl could sometimes create empty subroutine stubs when a

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_should_probably_b">/%s/ should probably be written as &quot;%s&quot;</a>
<dd>
(W syntax) You have used a pattern where Perl expected to find a string,
as in the first argument to <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#join_EXPR_LIST">join</a></code>.  Perl will treat the true
or false result of matching the pattern against $_ as the string,
which is probably not what you had in mind.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_called_too_early_">%s() called too early to check prototype</a>
<dd>
(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the parser saw a
definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check that the call
conforms to the prototype.  You need to either add an early prototype
declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the subroutine
definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype checking.  Alternatively,
if you are certain that you're calling the function correctly, you may put
an ampersand before the name to avoid the warning.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_s_argument_is_not_a">%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element</a>

See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="attributes.html">attributes</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="_in_cleanup_s">(in cleanup) %s</a>
<dd>
(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a DESTROY() method raised
the indicated exception.  Since destructors are usually called by
the system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast
number of times, the warning is issued only once for any number
of failures that would otherwise result in the same message being
repeated.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the <code>G_KEEPERR</code> flag

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Bareword_found_in_co">Bareword found in conditional</a>
<dd>
(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a conditional,
which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the
last argument of the previous construct, for example:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    open FOO || die;
</pre>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted
as a bareword:

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Buffer_overflow_in_p">Buffer overflow in prime_env_iter: %s</a>
<dd>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  While Perl was preparing to iterate over

(S) Currently, only scalar variables can declared with a specific class
qualifier in a &quot;my&quot; or &quot;our&quot; declaration.  The semantics may be extended
for other types of variables in future.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_declare_s_in_s">Can't declare %s in &quot;%s&quot;</a>
<dd>
(F) Only scalar, array, and hash variables may be declared as &quot;my&quot; or
&quot;our&quot; variables.  They must have ordinary identifiers as names.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_ignore_signal_">Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</a>
<dd>
(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD signal
(sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled.  Since disabling this signal
will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child
processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value.
This situation typically indicates that the parent program under
which Perl may be running (e.g., cron) is being very careless.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_modify_non_lva">Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call</a>
<dd>
(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as
such, see the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html#Lvalue_subroutines">Lvalue subroutines</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_read_CRTL_envi">Can't read CRTL environ</a>
<dd>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read an element of %ENV
from the CRTL's internal environment array and discovered the array was
missing.  You need to figure out where your CRTL misplaced its environ
or define <code>PERL_ENV_TABLES</code> (see the <u>perlvms</u> manpage) so that environ is not searched.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_remove_s_s_ski">Can't remove %s: %s, skipping file</a>
<dd>
(S) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup file.  Perl
was unable to remove the original file to replace it with the modified
file.  The file was left unmodified.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_return_s_from_">Can't return %s from lvalue subroutine</a>
<dd>
(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such
as temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue.
This is not allowed.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Can_t_weaken_a_nonre">Can't weaken a nonreference</a>

(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference.  Only
references can be weakened.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Character_class_s_un">Character class [:%s:] unknown</a>

(F) The class in the character class [: :] syntax is unknown.
See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlre.html">perlre</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Character_class_synt">Character class syntax [%s] belongs inside character classes</a>
<dd>
(W unsafe) The character class constructs [: :], [= =], and [. .]  go
<i>inside</i> character classes, the [] are part of the construct,
for example: /[012[:alpha:]345]/.  Note that [= =] and [. .]
are not currently implemented; they are simply placeholders for
future extensions.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Constant_is_not_s_re">Constant is not %s reference</a>
<dd>
(F) A constant value (perhaps declared using the <code>use constant</code> pragma)
is being dereferenced, but it amounts to the wrong type of reference.  The
message indicates the type of reference that was expected. This usually
indicates a syntax error in dereferencing the constant value.
See the section on <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html#Constant_Functions">Constant Functions</a> in the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a> manpage and the <a class="POD_LINK" href="constant.html">constant</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="constant_s_s">constant(%s): %s</a>
<dd>
(F) The parser found inconsistencies either while attempting to define an
overloaded constant, or when trying to find the character name specified
in the <code>\N{...}</code> escape.  Perhaps you forgot to load the corresponding
<code>overload</code> or <code>charnames</code> pragma?  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="charnames.html">charnames</a> manpage and the <a class="POD_LINK" href="overload.html">overload</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="CORE_s_is_not_a_keyw">CORE::%s is not a keyword</a>

(F) The CORE:: namespace is reserved for Perl keywords.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="defined_array_is_dep">defined(@array) is deprecated</a>

(D) defined() is not usually useful on arrays because it checks for an

just use <code>if (@array) { # not empty }</code> for example.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="defined_hash_is_depr">defined(%hash) is deprecated</a>

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="false_range_s_in_reg">false [] range &quot;%s&quot; in regexp</a>
<dd>
(W regexp) A character class range must start and end at a literal character, not
another character class like <code>\d</code> or <code>[:alpha:]</code>.  The &quot;-&quot; in your false
range is interpreted as a literal &quot;-&quot;.  Consider quoting the &quot;-&quot;,  &quot;\-&quot;.

(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for writing.  If you
intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it with
&quot;+&lt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with &quot;&lt;&quot; or nothing.  If

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Global_symbol_s_requ">Global symbol &quot;%s&quot; requires explicit package name</a>
<dd>
(F) You've said &quot;use strict vars&quot;, which indicates that all variables

&quot;our&quot;, or explicitly qualified to say which package the global variable
is in (using &quot;::&quot;).
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Hexadecimal_number_0">Hexadecimal number &gt; 0xffffffff non-portable</a>
<dd>
(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Ill_formed_CRTL_envi">Ill-formed CRTL environ value &quot;%s&quot;</a>
<dd>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the CRTL's internal

used to separate keys from values.  The element is ignored.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Ill_formed_message_i">Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|</a>
<dd>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read a logical name

<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Integer_overflow_in_">Integer overflow in %s number</a>
<dd>
(W overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified either
as a literal or as an argument to hex() or oct() is too big for your

32-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number
representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively.  Note that Perl
transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation

in 64-bit HP-UX.  The test attempts to create and connect to
&quot;multihomed&quot; sockets (sockets which have multiple IP addresses).

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="NEXTSTEP_3_3_POSIX_t">NEXTSTEP 3.3 POSIX test failure</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In NEXTSTEP 3.3p2 the implementation of the strftime(3) in the
operating system libraries is buggy: the %j format numbers the days of
a month starting from zero, which, while being logical to programmers,
will cause the subtests 19 to 27 of the lib/posix test may fail.

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Tru64_aka_Digital_UN">Tru64 (aka Digital UNIX, aka DEC OSF/1) lib/sdbm test failure with gcc</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If compiled with gcc 2.95 the lib/sdbm test will fail (dump core).
The cure is to use the vendor cc, it comes with the operating system
and produces good code.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="UNICOS_mk_CC_failure">UNICOS/mk CC failures during Configure run</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
In UNICOS/mk the following errors may appear during the Configure run:

	Guessing which symbols your C compiler and preprocessor define...
	CC-20 cc: ERROR File = try.c, Line = 3
	...
	  bad switch yylook 79bad switch yylook 79bad switch yylook 79bad switch yylook 79#ifdef A29K
	...
	4 errors detected in the compilation of &quot;try.c&quot;.
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The culprit is the broken awk of UNICOS/mk.  The effect is fortunately
rather mild: Perl itself is not adversely affected by the error, only
the h2ph utility coming with Perl, and that is rather rarely needed
these days.

<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Arrow_operator_and_a">Arrow operator and arrays</a></h3>
<pre class="POD_TEXT">
When the left argument to the arrow operator <code>-&gt;</code> is an array, or
the <code><a class="POD_LINK" href="perlfunc.html#scalar_EXPR">scalar</a></code> operator operating on an array, the result of the
operation must be considered erroneous. For example:

    @x-&gt;[2]
    scalar(@x)-&gt;[2]

These expressions will get run-time errors in some future release of
Perl.

As discussed above, many features are still experimental.  Interfaces and
implementation of these features are subject to change, and in extreme cases,
even subject to removal in some future release of Perl.  These features
include the following:

</dl>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="Obsolete_Diagnostics">Obsolete Diagnostics</a></h2>
<dl class="POD_LIST">
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Character_class_synt1">Character class syntax [: :] is reserved for future extensions</a>
<dd>
(W) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the syntax beginning
with &quot;[:&quot; and ending with &quot;:]&quot; is reserved for future extensions.
If you need to represent those character sequences inside a regular
expression character class, just quote the square brackets with the
backslash: &quot;\[:&quot; and &quot;:\]&quot;.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Ill_formed_logical_n">Ill-formed logical name |%s| in prime_env_iter</a>
<dd>
(W) A warning peculiar to VMS.  A logical name was encountered when preparing
to iterate over %ENV which violates the syntactic rules governing logical
names.  Because it cannot be translated normally, it is skipped, and will not
appear in %ENV.  This may be a benign occurrence, as some software packages
might directly modify logical name tables and introduce nonstandard names,
or it may indicate that a logical name table has been corrupted.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="In_string_s_now_must">In string, @%s now must be written as \@%s</a>
<dd>
The description of this error used to say:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
        (Someday it will simply assume that an unbackslashed @
         interpolates an array.)
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
That day has come, and this fatal error has been removed.  It has been
replaced by a non-fatal warning instead.
See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="#Arrays_now_always_in">Arrays now always interpolate into double-quoted strings</a> entry elsewhere in this document for
details.
</p>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Probable_precedence_">Probable precedence problem on %s</a>
<dd>
(W) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a conditional,
which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the
last argument of the previous construct, for example:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    open FOO || die;
</pre>
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="regexp_too_big">regexp too big</a>
<dd>
(F) The current implementation of regular expressions uses shorts as
address offsets within a string.  Unfortunately this means that if
the regular expression compiles to longer than 32767, it'll blow up.
Usually when you want a regular expression this big, there is a better
way to do it with multiple statements.  See the <a class="POD_LINK" href="perlre.html">perlre</a> manpage.
<dt class="POD_ITEM"><a name="Use_of_digit_to_mean">Use of &quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; to mean &quot;${$}&lt;digit&gt;&quot; is deprecated</a>
<dd>
(D) Perl versions before 5.004 misinterpreted any type marker followed
by &quot;$&quot; and a digit.  For example, &quot;$$0&quot; was incorrectly taken to mean
&quot;${$}0&quot; instead of &quot;${$0}&quot;.  This bug is (mostly) fixed in Perl 5.004.
<p class="POD_TEXT">
However, the developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug completely,
because at least two widely-used modules depend on the old meaning of
&quot;$$0&quot; in a string.  So Perl 5.004 still interprets &quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; in the
old (broken) way inside strings; but it generates this message as a
warning.  And in Perl 5.005, this special treatment will cease.
